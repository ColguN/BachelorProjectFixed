AlanSantana,üÖ±Ô∏è Ethereum Will Hit Bottom Before Bitcoin,2,Initial post,1715250618.0,"I would like to call your attention to Bitcoin's monthly chart, as well as Ethereum's ... Bitcoin is worse off right now.

Ethereum is doing worse but this means that the correction is more advanced on this pair; below you can find Ethereum's monthly chart and analysis:

‚ûñ While Ethereum is 33% down, Bitcoin is only 17% down.
‚ûñ While for Bitcoin April closed within March's wick low, for Ethereum the close was much lower compared to its previous month producing a penetration of support. April's monthly close for Ethereum fully confirms the next bearish move (down).

‚ûñ Ethereum and Bitcoin move together.
‚ûñ Ethereum, Bitcoin and the entire global financial markets are connected and what happens in one place affects everything.

Conclusion

üëâ Ethereum is likely to hit bottom before Bitcoin.

This is important for those who are going to try and catch the bottom in anticipation of the next Cryptocurrency market bull-run.

Namaste."

The market is great.

Even though we get confirmation after confirmation, doubts still creeps in.
Even though we see the market moving just as we would expect it to move based on the cycle, sentiment and chart signals; confirmation after confirmation, for real.

Somehow, each time there is a small rise in price doubt creeps in.

‚ûñ Will Bitcoin move to hit a new All-Time High next?
‚ûñ Is the correction over?
‚ûñ How can I be certain prices will not continue higher?
‚ûñ How can I be certain prices will continue lower?

""Bitcoin is trading above $60,000 after all and that's pretty strong.""

Well, actually, below 70K is ultra-bearish after a new ATH at 74K, but this is not the topic for this update.

In early 2022 we were discussing here on TradingView the bear-market that was developing for Crypto and how far down Bitcoin would go.

We were dead set on finding the target and as you know, we shared hundreds and hundreds of charts. All of us, the different players.

After a while, we decided that Bitcoin was going to settle around 20K because that was the 2017 ATH. We concluded that the bottom would happen in June or November 2021 and reach several others and varied conclusions.

We all agreed and everything was clear; it was early 2022, we still had a long way to go before reaching 20K; Bitcoin crashed below 20K and yes, even 15K was tested as support.

A certain public figure, I won't name any names, said in early 2022 that Bitcoin would move lower but stay above 30K. It doesn't matter what happens it would never go below 30K... Bitcoin was trading in the 40Ks at the time.

Sure enough, that was the signal...
Bitcoin crashed and did not move below 30K but went even lower and hit below 16K.

The same character is now saying that ""Bitcoin will stay in $55K to $75K zone for now"" ... This means that the crash is confirmed and it is going below 30K.

üÖ±Ô∏è Time To Trade

Right now we are witnessing a ""bounce.""

Each time an important level is hit, either up (resistance) or down (support), the market reacts with a move to the opposite side, in this case a ""price jump"" or ""bounce.""

‚ûñ How we do know if this is just a bounce instead of the start of a new bullish wave?

The trading volume gives it away... There is no volume.

And of course, the market movers (whales/exchanges) will definitely liquidate the SHORTs before producing a new low.

You see, Crypto is deposited into the exchange.
You use this Crypto to buy stuff.

When this Crypto sits around on the exchange wallet, they take this money and loan it out and you get something... Sometimes, if you are in the earn program if not, they make money on your money and that's ok but the problem is that now the market turns.

‚ûñ If you are trading spot, the value of your Cryptos can rise or fall ‚Äînothing happens; just wait.
‚ûñ If you are using margin or leverage, your entire account can be gone.

That's why there is a move up before going lower, because the whales want money... And many people use too much leverage; now, that's their fault.

We are not going to single out whales and exchanges, everybody is working to make money, that's the final goal.

The reason why these people get liquidated is not because billionaires are evil, but because their leverage is too high, we are talking about 15X, 20X, 25X etc. In truth, 1-2X first and then we use a little more. Anything higher without years of planning can be called gambling, but i don't know. I am not a gambler so I can't really say, I only read the charts.

I've been around ""leveraged trading"" and if you are not a professional, it is very likely that you are fooling yourself and wasting money as you go.

If that's not the case... üëâ Then BTCUSDT is an easy hold.

What will it be?
Down or up?

The chart continues 100% clear.
We have another lower high...

It doesn't matter if you miss the game today but...

What about tomorrow?
What about next week, next month?
What about years into the future?

How long have you been trading for?

Are you successful?
Are you profitable?

How long have you been working for?

Are you rich?
Are you satisfied?
Are you happy?

You see... Whatever you put in, in time, is what you receive.

Whatever the world gives to you is based on your actions, your behavior, your mentality, your thoughts.

How much money one makes will depend on the state of mind, the experience; how honest you are with yourself?

This market can be tough... If you are an egotist, you are going to get out of here broke.

On the other hand, if you can accept and appreciate your mistakes; taking responsibility for your actions rather than blaming others; the market definitely pays with success.

First we focus on personal growth and this growth will lead to a stable mind and with this stable mind we can trade.

üçÄ AFFIRMATIONS TO ATTRACT ABUNDANCE

Whenever a feeling of lack or need comes to your beautiful mind, immediately replace it for one or more of the following affirmations; they are meant to attract wealth and abundance to your life ‚Äînow!

""Everyday in every way, my wealth is increasing.""

You can choose one or more and repeat them often ‚Äîthree times before sleep and right after waking up!

""I deserve prosperity and I accept prosperity in my life now!""

""I have a wonderful work, in a wonderful way, I give wonderful service, for a wonderful pay!""

Some people repeat them 10,000 times per day!
It works; try it!

Re-read this post, over and over, again and again ...

""I am so happy and grateful now, that money comes to me, in increasing quantities, from multiple sources, on a continuous basis.""

""By day and by night I am being prospered in all of my interests.""

There is no virtue in poverty; it is a disease like any other mental disease.

Change your mental attitude toward money with the following affirmation:

""I like money, I love it, I use it wisely, constructively and judiciously. Money is constantly in my life, I release it with joy and it returns to me multiplied in a wonderful way. It is good, very good. Money flows to me in avalanches of abundance. I use it for good only and I am grateful for my good and for the riches of my mind.""

I love you!

Thanks a lot for your amazing and continued support.

It is true that Bitcoin is now showing multiple very strong bullish signals and this is no cause for alarm; Bitcoin being bullish is always good for us and the Cryptocurrency market as a whole. We love Bitcoin/Crypto!

First, the chart:

‚ûñ Bitcoin closed weekly full green and back above EMA10. This means that the bulls are in full control when it comes to the short-term potential. Where the action is headed next.

‚ûñ Next, Bitcoin is trading above $60,000 which is ultra-bullish and this after months of a strong distribution/consolidation phase...

What happens now?

üëâ Yes Bitcoin is bullish and set to move to $100,000 and much, much higher in the long-term but, regardless of the short-term noise, we will see a crash in the coming days.

Bitcoin is likely to produce a lower high, not move higher and retrace to hit new lows before the major bullish wave. This fact doesn't change even though, Bitcoin is bullish!

üÖ±Ô∏è Impossible To Predict: Mixed Signals

What we've been seeing lately is a quite complex situation and one of the hardest, if not the hardest of all, to predict based on Technical Analysis. Bitcoin is mixed!

Mixed because we have a mixture of bullish and bearish signals.
‚ûñ Bullish technicals, with bearish potential.
‚ûñ Bullish conditions with bearish developments.

With a more than two months long consolidation pattern, Bitcoin can go either way.
A consolidation pattern can be either bullish or bearish, but it is a very well known fact that a consolidation pattern can only be confirmed after the breakout.

Say a pattern has a 60/40 chance, or even 80/20 between bullish and bearish and yet the bearish side, even with the lower potential can develop. In reverse, a bullish breakout can happen anytime.

The market is mixed 50/50 based on this and other signals, I can expand, and this is the very annoying situation for traders and holders alike. What will you do knowing this?

There are tens of thousands of Altcoins trading pairs and these will start fluctuating even more when the next breakout comes.

The majority of the Altcoins are set to produce a major crash, another crash which will lead to the final support being established, the correction bottom low.

Now, some people are in a bit of hurry to see prices moving down or up but that's not how the market works. The market tend to take its time and only when most people break will the market move.

Right now things are not clear but Bitcoin can go up, up, up... Bitcoin can go up.

The next major move is a very, very strong drop... It can happen within 6 days just as it can take 3-4 weeks but not much more. (Mid June 2024 for the bottom.)

You can wait for the breakout and profit all the way to $100K.
Smart readers will either stay out or wait patiently, because it is much more wiser to wait for the crash rather than buying to see everything drop the next day.

It doesn't matter what the market do next and that we cannot predict... But we can prepare because we know that action is always going on. Instead of looking for the next big one, the 10,000%+, instead we focus on daily wins, a winning strategy and this winning strategy can produce positive long-term results.

I remember back in those days when I used to focus on the short-term.
I would go to the 5minutes chart, 15minutes can ""confirm"" whatever I was seeing, over and over, and yet somehow the market always moved the other way.

My efforts were a pure waste, of energy, because the bigger picture didn't change no matter how much my anxieties and stress built up.

So, instead of trying to guess the next move of the market why not prepare for both scenarios knowing that what goes down, must move back up.

‚ûñ Bitcoin has been rising since day 1.
‚ûñ Bitcoin has been moving up since it was created, since its first trading day.
‚ûñ Bitcoin will continue growing, there is no doubt, so why would anybody worry about a correction that will only last a few days?

It is impossible to predict the future but Bitcoin is soon going down, would you like to bet?

Namaste."

A friendly piece of advice based on more than 10 years of trading experience...

Hello dear Cryptocurrency lover, I am back sharing some of my experience with you today. I am hoping that you find this information useful for your learning journey.

Problems arise due to the expectations we hold.

Say what you will, but if you are buying/holding Cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin, you are likely doing so with the expectation of making money (speculation).

Having the wrong expectations can wreak havoc to your mental and financial well-being if things do not develop according to what we predict. So the first thing we do is to remove all expectations.

Say you are buying an Altcoin trading pair with the goal of earning 150% from a bullish move; an up-move.

You decide to buy this pair now and sure enough, the market starts to grow.
Say the market grows for 1 week, 2 weeks straight up... It tends to fluctuate as seen on the chart but for the sake of simplicity let's say the market moves up 80% and then stops.

The market can grow 2-3 weeks straight for a total of 100% and then reverse fully.
While the initial move went up, it did not reach our 150% target so we end up holding and the ensuing correction can lead to a flash crash and then a waiting of four months before prices move back up to the initial entry level.

One can buy and see 20% up, 30% up fast and then things start to reverse... What was once an easy and fast win, can turn into a long-term hold or into a loss because we can have a 50% target but the market only grew by 40%... Let's clarify this example now using Bitcoin.

Imagine you buy Bitcoin at $65,000 with a LONG bias.
Say Bitcoin grows and hits $73,000; are you going to sell?

Say Bitcoin grows even higher and hits $84,000, 20% higher compared $70,000; are you going to sell?

Because Bitcoin can go up 20% but then reverse and move to $60,000.
Now, $60,000 is below the $65,000 entry level in this example; what would you do now? Hold or take the loss?

What if Bitcoin moves then to $50,000?

Remember, it did move up to $80,000, $90,000, etc. in this example before moving lower, but we didn't sell in expectations of higher prices!

What if $50,000 breaks as support and Bitcoin moves to $40K? Sell now or hold?

Will Bitcoin move from $40,000 to $100,000?
Or will Bitcoin move from $40,000 to $20,000?

It is impossible to know.

This is what we know with 100% certainty!

You were not around in early 2023.

Where were you in early 2023 when Bitcoin was trading below $20,000?
Why not buy at this amazing price when the chart was ultra-bullish?

You see, Bitcoin and the Cryptocurrency market never moves straight up!

Do this, go open the chart as BTCUSDT.
Choose the weekly timeframe and look at January 2018. What do you see?

After a massive period of growth, we get a massive period of prices moving down.

Don't believe?
Let's try again.

Look at November 2021? What do you see?

After a very strong period of growth, we get a massive correction lasting years not month.

Look now at early 2024!
Bitcoin grew from November 2022 through March 2024.
After massive growth a very strong correction tends to follow.

Did you ever saw a bullish article on television, the news, the media; telling you to buy Bitcoin at $16K?

Have you ever seen a news article telling you to sell Bitcoin in 2021 when it was at the top at 69K? No!

All these articles tend to reflect what is happening in the moment and what is happening in the moment is already priced in, the market is looking for the next move when most people become active.

The reason why the majority is always wrong is because they only hear about these things such as Bitcoin, this market, after it is already high up.

The best time to buy is when prices are down, not at the top.

Say you are a long-term holder and you want to buy Bitcoin for the long-term, so you don't care; Still, it is better to buy at $40,000, $30,000 or $25,000 rather than buying at $60,000 or $70,000... Makes sense?

How far up can it go?

Do this exercise... Visualize Bitcoin going up, up, up... How far up can it go?
$150,000? $200,000? $400,000?

Will you sell?
If yes, when and by how much?
Would you sell everything or just a portion?

Do you see how complex it is?

It becomes extremely easy when you buy at the bottom and sell as prices increase.

Patience is key!

Thanks a lot for your continued support.

Note: Just wait, the market is not going anywhere... I sold everything long ago.
We will see in 2-3 weeks time if the bottom of the correction is already in or if we will get a new market bottom low... I am betting on a new low, what about you?

The Ethereum condition right now is quite revealing. The analysis has been shared in a different trade idea. Bitcoin and Ethereum's situation is the same... Look at this:


This is Bitcoin on the daily timeframe; notice:

‚ûñ TD Sequential perfect nine (bearish).
‚ûñ Lower high still in place.
‚ûñ Low volume on yesterday strong bullish move. Such a strong move, set to move higher, would produce an ""above-average"" trading volume day. Instead the daily volume is low.

Of course, things can change but so far the bearish potential remains intact.
It remains intact below 72/74K.

üëâ We continue bearish an expecting the pre-2025 bull-market correction.

Being honest and straight forward, can you imagine the amount of pain that can be caused if this is it?

Here is the weekly timeframe:

What do I mean with ""this is it?""

TradingView's Bitcoin index chart is the best because of the volume. It uses a combination of volume from multiple exchanges giving us a better picture as to what is really happening with the market action.

Is this it?

We've been tracking this amazing asset, Bitcoin, and we've been expecting a correction.
The peak/ATH remains at March 2024.

The longer it takes for prices to drop, the strongest the potential for the ensuing move.
üëâ Since Bitcoin's bearish potential remains intact while Bitcoin has been above 60K for 3 months; the ensuing correction can turn into a crash rather a ""normal correction.""

Notice the wording on the latest Ethereum news release, it says, ""People are buying the rumor...""
The rumor for the SPOT ETF... Reminds me of something, ""Buy the rumor, sell the news!""

The current situation is interesting to say the least, for both bulls and bears.

The last two weekly session has no volume.
Both candles volume is very low.

We use volume to identify a move; real or fake?
By fake we mean a ""short-squeeze."" This means that prices are moving up as a whales-market move in order to liquidate leveraged traders. Once the SHORT traders liquidation is over and done, Bitcoin will resume with its move down and produce a new lower low.

A lower low compared to $56,500... üëâ Which means that Bitcoin will soon trade below 50K.

Remember, we have all the days left in May and also June for the main low to be in... It can be wild, don't get trapped in this mixed situation, read the previous updates and make sure to do your research, take your time to plan and study because the market is not going away.

Since Bitcoin is here to stay; Since we are buying and trading Bitcoin long-term; It is better to wait for the best prices before making any moves... When in doubt, sit it out.

You can thank me later...

Think about it, do you really belief it will move straight up?
If yes, what's the next final target?

Is it $76,000, $84,000, $90,000 or more?

If you say more and Bitcoin does move up and hits $100K, will you sell or hold?

That's my question for you... Try to answer in the comments below but also consider, what would you do if there is no new highs and Bitcoin crashes toward the low 20Ks?

These last questions are not a prediction; we prepare for all scenarios, bearish and bullish. So I am trying to share our experience with you... It is not just me, there are thousands and thousands of us that have been here for many years and want you to avoid the discomfort that we had to go through when we were in the same situation but years ago.

Anything can happen but the chart doesn't look great for LONG.
The chart looks good for selling, SHORT or HOLD.

I am waiting, literally... We will see based on the results.

The Altcoins will be mixed as they continue to be mixed now, just as predicted and it will get worse.
We will have pairs going up, others going down while others go sideways... This is good for trading not bad, because we know there are always opportunities for growth.

We are seeing some pairs 50% down, while others are 80% up.
We are seeing new highs being hit, as well as new market bottom lows.

üëâ We buy the low ones and sell those high up.

Sounds good to me, how does that sound to you?

The universe will bless those that dedicate time and energy to learning, preparation and personal growth. This is the recipe needed for success in the 2025 Cryptocurrency bull-market but this bull-market that ends in 2025 will start in 2024.

Just one more final drop; After this drop several major shakeouts (be aware of 2-3 additional swings after the low is in), and after the shakeouts UP WE GO!

The most important of all the signals, details and action to consider is...

Love & support.
I'll give you the content and you send me love.

AlanSantana,üÖ±Ô∏è Final Warning: A 50% Capitulation Drop Will Lead To 30K,30,Initial post,1714194719.0,"This is the final warning and a friendly reminder; what we are about to witness is a ""capitulation drop!""

This event is not your common drop or ""normal correction,"" instead, it is a major event that only happens once every several years and you have front row sits for it.

‚ûñ If we calculate the average price for Bitcoin's trading range in the past month and a half, we get a number around $66,600.

‚ûñ If we divide this number by two, the 50% capitulation drop, we get a number in the range of $33,300.

üëâ Here is my idea of how Bitcoin will behave around this number if a capitulation drop does show up in the coming days or next month; May 2024 ... But first, let me tell you that May is normally a bad month for Cryptocurrency when the action is coming out of a multiple-years price high ‚Äîthat is BTCUSDT. This is the situation in which we are at today.

Bitcoin is trading at the highest prices ever and has been on distribution for quite a while now, this phase is about to reach soon two months.

This phase can last, it can last 3 months, 4 months and sometimes even a total of 6 months before the capitulation actually happens but do not worry, it won't extend this much this time around because the halving just took place.

Boost this trade idea and we will comeback for frequent updates.

So it is likely that this is it, the capitulation happens now, this or next month, and this is what we've been waiting for to start the new phase, the new wave, the new entry, the bull-market that will really heat up late, very late 2024 and all throughout 2025. All throughout 2025 it will be super, it will be big, it will be great; it will be the opportunity we have been waiting for.

What are you doing now?

Is not really about Bitcoin going to $100,000 before a correction or whatnot or predicting what happens next; It is really about buying when prices are low, waiting patiently and selling high at the top of the bullish wave.

‚ûñ The time to buy was last year or after the flush takes place.
‚ûñ The time to sell will be next year, after the bull-run is on its way.

Whatever the market does in the mid to short-term, there are always clear signals before a reversal takes place.

Look at the chart; volume continues to drop, the RSI becomes weaker every day. The loss of bullish momentum is the major indicator we have predicting a bearish wave.

The action should go something like this: The initial drop fast and strong; remember that the initial move is bearish marketwide, period. Then this move stabilizes and the ALTSBTC and smaller Altcoins will recover first. Mid-size second and the biggest one last.

Bitcoin is likely to recover 30-50% from the flash crash bottom low and then start a slow climb. Something like hitting ~30K in a flash and then moving to around ~45K to produce very strong volatility but to never look back, straight up but very slow growth for months and months... Imagine 6-8 months within a bullish consolidation phase. Rising but slowly until in Q1/Q2 2025 when everything really starts to speed up.

üëâ So only one bottom and that's it... We will have to rush if we want to buy BTC.

The rest we will have plenty of time, it will be wild, it will be fast, it will be crazy, exciting... For many it will be profitable for others it will be bad as loses can add up for the unprepared and can even multiply.

Prepare now or plan, if not by doing numbers at least try and visualize... What would you do if you knew Bitcoin would hit ~30K before hitting a new All-Time High?

Share in the comments section below... In 2025, Bitcoin will hit a new All-Time High!

Looking at the other side and maintaining and open perspective, Bitcoin continues bullish on the weekly timeframe.

One of the main indicators we look at for a potential change of trend, is based on the moving average of ten periods (EMA10). Bitcoin briefly moved below this level last week but ended up closing above it; see the chart:

‚ûñ Weekly EMA10 now stands at $63,000.
üëâ Bullish above; bearish below.

On top of this little fact we also have a bull flag as a major pattern on the chart.

The potential is bearish based on many signals that I already explained in previous trade ideas; volume, waves, market cycle, etc.

We continue bearish on Bitcoin and expect prices to move lower (lower low) before moving higher (new ATH).

Thank you for reading.

üÖ±Ô∏è Bitcoin Is Here To Stay!

While some people right now are calling for a major bear-market, the end of the bullish cycle and a crash toward $11,300; some are even making mention of $3,000 and even $1,000 ... No comment.

Wait! ...
Yes comment!

It is an actual impossibility for Bitcoin to hit below $15,000; don't you agree?

In fact, it is impossible for Bitcoin to even move below $20,000... In the worst case scenario we are looking at a price range of $21,000 - $24,000 as the worst case bottom scenario for a flash crash or black swan event.

Bitcoin is here to stay!

Bitcoin is the greatest invention since the Internet, for now, but it might actually turn out to be the best invention since money, actual cash.

In the age of information, technology; Bitcoin will be as important as your method of transport or even as your sacred and divine smart phone, that's how good Bitcoin is.

‚ûñ We all agree that a bull-market takes place after the halving ‚Äîyes?

‚ûñ We all agree that a new All-Time High is always hit a year after the halving, don't we?

‚ûñ And we might all agree that a correction, at least one, is always present before the long-term bullish cycle develops that ends in a bull-run, just as it happened back in 2021 and 2017...

Bitcoin is here to stay!!!

It doesn't matter what anybody say;
It doesn't matter how prices trade or move short-term;
It doesn't matter if the crash leads to 30 or 40K...
Bitcoin is here to stay!

Let's say it drops a little bit; yes, big deal... Those who really love and understand Bitcoin can simply hold/wait!

Thanks a lot for your continued support.

‚ûñ Bitcoin is now trading weekly below EMA10.
We are officially in bearish territory after four weeks of BTCUSDT closing red and a total of seven weeks of sideways action.


‚ûñ Sideways price action can be considered neutral or bullish but the fact that the action is moving below EMA10 makes this a bearish development.

‚ûñ If we look back to October 2023 on the weekly timeframe, BTCUSDT never trades below EMA10 weekly. As the bullish force is active, the action always remain above this indicator's line (green on this chart). Moving below signals that the bulls are losing momentum.

The week is early; the week is new though.

This is indeed a bearish development and Bitcoin is set to move lower but, this is just the start of the week. The action can as easily move back up above EMA10, the weekly session turn green and the entire seven weeks of sideways action become a very healthy consolidation phase. It would support perfectly a rise beyond 84,000 to maybe 90,000 or even 100K. That's the hopelessly greedy scenario that some are contemplating and let's hope it becomes true.

It can be a strong drop, a month or two, but we grow long-term.
No matter what happens in the short-term, winners are patient and know how to hold and wait; patiently of course.

üÖ±Ô∏è Bitcoin Monthly

Just as with the weekly timeframe, Bitcoin has gone red on the monthly.

‚ûñ April 2024 is the first month red since August 2023.
‚ûñ April closing red signals the end of the bullish wave.
‚ûñ April closing red points to May being the correction month. The meat of the correction will happen in May 2024.

‚ûñ After such strong growth (BTCUSD from Nov. 2022 through March 2024), we get at least another month red.
‚ûñ Another month red can push prices below 40K; why below $42,000?
Because $42,000 is below Februarys low... Regardless of how far down it goes it will take a while to recover to the same prices we had back in March 2024, it can take months.

One needs to be strong to hold through the storm.

Let's look at Bitcoin daily up close:

Notice the highlighted candles, this is out of the ordinary.

This type of action we are seeing, five days below EMA50 with small candles with small real bodies, all red; this is a type of bearish consolidation that will lead to a lower low.

If you look at past history, you don't see this type of action before a bullish breakout. For this to be bullish, it would need to happen above the EMAs. Since it is happening below, it is bearish; what do you think?

üÖ±Ô∏è Bitcoin Weekly | Quick Chart Update

One of the patterns that kept many people waiting for bearish confirmation, understandably, is the bull-flag. Here we have a bull-flag on the weekly timeframe, obviously a very strong pattern.


This pattern tends to be considered bullish and indeed it is, but patterns and signals cannot be considered in isolation. All signals and data points coming from the charts must be considered in combination with other signals for them to be of value to us.

While a bull-flag is considered a bullish continuation pattern, to us this is not the case when the market is trading at multi-year highs. Weakness is revealed after 8 weeks of sideways and 4 weeks consecutive closing red with lower highs; that's the context.

Right now we have a breakdown of the bullish flag and this is noted by the current candle moving below the lower trendline. The break below EMA10 is also there. Confirmation only happens once the week closes.

The fact that this is happening mid-week, at this point, is also a bearish signal.

Bearish, bearish, bearish, bearish... How far down will it really go?

üëâ We are open to all scenarios... Bitcoin already lost $60,000 and $58,000 as support. Minimum we go to 50/52K next... But after this level, how far down will it go?

40K? 30k? 20K? 10K?

I don't know... Leave a comment with your guess.

Mine is as good as yours.

One very important point to keep in mind is the duration of the correction.

When we use the general term ""short-term"" we are referring here to a period of 1-3 months. Everybody uses these terms differently but for us it means within 30-90 days.

This correction is a ""short-term"" move.
It should last only within 1-3 months.

Here the tricky and interesting points to note:

1) Bitcoin peaked 14-March 2024. While some people are realizing only now that Bitcoin is dropping, it has been in its bearish wave for 1.5 months (technically speaking).

2) The low can hit after 2 months or 3 months, etc. So the entire correction can last, say, 2.5 months (75 days). After the low is in, it can take 1-3 months for prices to move back up to current levels or even more... That's the interesting part.

While the correction ""just started"" for many, it has been going for almost two months.

While the entire correction phase should end fast, for many, it can last between 4-6 months, the entire period.

It can take 4-8 months from March 2024 until Bitcoin is back up to the same levels and challenging resistance in order to hit new All-Time Highs (2025).

All this information leads me to realize just one thing: The market offers endless opportunities and patience is key to win!

When Bitcoin drops the initial reaction is negative across the entire market.

While many of the big Altcoins already completed their full correction, with a strong Bitcoin drop this would still push prices lower on all those pairs. The initial reaction can be strong all across but it can settle very quickly.

Many pairs already hit bottom and can grow even if Bitcoin drops, thinks ALTSBTC. Some of the ALTSUSDT can also move forward but only after the initial reaction and those that didn't produce a major bullish wave early 2024/late 2023.

Each chart/pair needs to be considered individually at this point.

üìà How To Know Which Altcoins Will Grow And Which Ones Will Move Lower | How Far Down Can A Pair Really Go? Altcoins Market Map Revealed!

Ok. There are tens of thousands of Altcoins trading pairs and this is the reason why it is obvious to consider each pair individually. There is no point in making generalisations because there are just too many of us.

Some people can have a 1-3% stop-loss while others can have a 20-30% stop-loss. A correction can affect very different an investor, a long-term trader, a day-trader, scalper, futures trader and so on.

Some will go down while others go up but there is a way to identify exactly at which point in the cycle each pair is currently at.

As always, I am an open book ... and I am sharing my experience, wisdom and knowledge with you. I am sending you LOVE! ... Know, that I love YOU!

Ok, let's get started!

‚ûñ How do I know if the trading pair that I am interested in is likely to move lower or higher based on the current market situation?

‚ûñ How do I know how far down a pair can go in this correction?

Let's start by saying that we can't know for sure and thus we are only going to be making some approximations. We look at the pairs that are more advanced within the current market cycle and whatever they are doing the rest will do the same. This is the method we used to find the main resistance levels on the way up for the previous bullish wave and the method I used to find the main support levels for the current bearish wave. It is the same method I will use to predict the next set of targets when the next bullish wave comes in a matter of months.

The majority of the Altcoins (we are talking about USDT pairs here), hit a low around September/October 2023. All these Altcoins went ahead to produce a very strong bullish wave. This wave peaked late 2023 for many, many Altcoins ‚Äîsome of the smaller ones that many of you are not looking at, while others continued through 2024 and present day.

Now, some pairs grew between 2-3X while others grew 10-15X.
The correction potential for those that grew between 10-15X is much stronger compared to those that grew only 2-3X. Cardano is a great example; while some other projects (like Solana) have to move much lower, Cardano doesn't have much lower to go or the bottom might be already in. Might be, there can be another drop but just to give you an example.

Another example is XRPUSDT.
This pair potentially bottomed while some others still have to go through the whole corrective phase. Now, and this is the hard part, many pairs are in-between their correction and these are the ones that I want to expose to you.

Say the bullish wave is over, Solana (SOLUSDT).

üëâ The correction is likely to end around the 0.618 - 0.786 Fib. retracement range for the entire bullish wave.

We can be talking about a bullish wave that lasted 300 days or 30 days, makes no difference at this point.

We plot the ""Fib Retracement"" tool with the value '0' being the last high, this is the price that hit early 2024 or late 2023 for most pairs. The next value, '1', should be plotted at the last major low before the bullish wave; the bearish cycle bottom. Doing this will give you the Fibonacci retracement numbers for the entire bullish wave.

If you find a pair, using the weekly timeframe, where a wick or candle pierced through these levels, you can feel sure that the correction low is likely in. If it isn't in, then one more low and that's it.

This low won't necessarily lead to a straight up arrow as the next bullish jump. If it does, it would be a wave five of a bullish impulse leading to a major correction then higher low before the bull-market takes place.

Now, the general scenario that is likely to develop on most chart goes as follows: A drop in the above mentioned range, then an accumulation/consolidation phase forming kind of a cup pattern, can last 2-4 months and then the action starts going all the way through 2025 and new All-Time Highs.

The correction cannot be avoided.
We have a long-term triple top.

Leave a comment with your support, sending me some love and some questions.

üÖ±Ô∏è Bitcoin | Bullish Signals

Today is Sunday and the week is about to close. There is only 8 hours left on the weekly candle/session... We have some bullish signals to look at.

While we have a bearish bias, we continue to keep an open perspective and always follow the chart.
While we believe Bitcoin is moving lower, this is only because the chart says so. If the chart changes, we also change!

Here we have Bitcoin on the weekly timeframe:

‚ÄîTrading above EMA10 = bullish.

Bitcoin moved back above EMA10 and has a long lower wick/shadow on the current session. This lower wick means that the bears sold, try to push prices lower but failed. The failure to push prices lower turns this into a bullish signal.

‚ÄîVolume

Volume is good and rising. This is a bullish signal. Bitcoin closing above EMA10 weekly ($63,150), is positive for the bulls short-term.

‚ÄîSupport holds

This weekly session only wicked below the 4-March low. Closing above this level is a signal of strength.
(It would be extremely bearish if the market turns red and the week ends up closing below.)

‚ÄîGreen weekly close

If the week closes green, this is positive.
A negative close would be ultra-bearish but so far it is looking good.

There is still room for prices to fluctuate, as in the 65-74,000 price range but, these signals point to higher prices in the coming days... Do you agree?

üÖ±Ô∏è Bitcoin Short-Term Move | 65,000 Or 68,000?

Bitcoin is now definitely bullish on the 4H timeframe;
By Bitcoin being bullish on this timeframe it means that prices are now moving higher; set to move higher, climbing up.

We can clearly see here how Bitcoin is trading above all moving averages with a bullish continuation pattern and bullish MACD.

üëâ While this is all great, it allows more time for the Altcoins to grow, remember that this is a short-term move and massive resistance awaits below 70K.

üëâ There can be very strong resistance around 67-70K and this range can end up resulting in a lower high compared to mid-March which can lead to a monthly lower low.

There is also the scenario where Bitcoin cannot grow beyond 65K, now, and decides to move straight down (blue arrows on the chart):

üÖ±Ô∏è Bitcoin For Beginners | Short-Term vs Long-Term

Sorry for creating confusion my dear readers, I shall explain.

The charts we read are based on different ""timeframes."" Each timeframe denotes a certain time horizon. The longer the timeframe, the more data becomes available for analysis on the chart.

The shorter the term, less data becomes available.

If we are looking at the 1H or 4H timeframes, these are considered short-term and whatever information is captured from these charts should only be considered in the short-term. Since each candle/session has only 1/4 hours, then the chart changes every 1/4 hours. But, if we look at the weekly timeframe, this we call long-term as it takes an entire week before the chart can change.

So, bullish short-term, bullish mid-term and bullish long-term.

There is bearish potential short-term for a major correction to develop which is already in the chart.
Bitcoin closed red for more than 4 weeks and has been ranging with swings being 20% each. A 20% move counter-trend can be defined as either a retrace or correction.

The thesis here is that before the next higher high, there can be a new lower low compared to the most recent low, that is, Bitcoin can move to the low 50Ks or lower... But things can change.

Whenever Bitcoin is trading now above $70,000 to $72,000, this is considered bullish.
‚ûñ If Bitcoin moves above $74,000, this is ultra-bullish.
‚ûñ If Bitcoin trades below $70,000, this is bearish confirmed short-term because Bitcoin is moving within a lower high after the March 2024 All-Time High.

Your comments are a true support.

Thanks a lot for the amazing, honest and open criticism, it helps and inspires me to write such posts.

Keep them coming.

üÖ±Ô∏è An ABC Correction Can't Be Over!

An ABC correction has four main points: The start of wave A (zero), wave A, wave B and wave C.

Regardless of the type of correction; flat or irregular, we only get four main points for the move to be completed.

‚ûñ The end of wave A can be a higher low compared to the end of wave C.
‚ûñ The end of wave B can be either a higher high compared to the ATH or a lower higher. This determines if the correction is either regular or irregular, but it doesn't change the fact that two main reactions are needed on the lower side of the equation for a correction to be complete.

Complex?
Hard to understand?
What do you mean?

Let's look at the chart:

Trading volume continues to drop.
Notice how one final drop is still needed for a classic ABC correction to be completed. We need two reactions on the lower end of the wave pattern (A & C). We are missing wave C.

üëâ Everything is set to crash including the Altcoins.

You've been warned!

This is a friendly reminder and intended only for your convenience.

Bitcoin will soon be 2 full months in the red. This will only lead the market to produce the final correction low and once the low is in we can start buying to enjoy the bullish rally; sustained long-term growth (2025 & late 2024).

It seems this week and next week will be very important, the distribution period is leading to such.

I am still in doubt if the distribution phase will end now, this/next week, or if it will last another two months (4 months total for the bottom low to be set)... Very hard to say, don't you agree?

Looking at the trading volume on this chart, we can see it stalled completed; this can be interpreted as the market reaching an equilibrium.

A drop in volume is also indicative of a decline in momentum.

üÖ±Ô∏è Bitcoin Weekly Update

Remember the weekly timeframe?
Bitcoin is now trading below EMA10!

Last time we were tracking this indicator, Bitcoin moved to hit a new lower low but recovered and closed above EMA10 by the end of the week. We have a bias at this point, a bearish bias but, if the chart changes we must adapt and change because our method is based on the chart.

As Bitcoin trades above EMA10 weekly, we remain bearish but cautious because this is a bullish development. And so, we would say to simplify things for our followers, readers and supporters: ""If Bitcoin trades above 72/74K = bullish. If Bitcoin trades below 70K = bearish/SHORT.""

‚ûñ It is the first time that Bitcoin will move below EMA10 weekly in more than 8 months.

‚ûñ It is the first time that Bitcoin will move below EMA10 weekly after a multi-year high in more than 2.5 years; a long time.

I am sharing this to say that this is a major bearish development and a full confirmation of the major crash that is about to take place.

As soon as EMA10 is lost as support, the next level opens up.

The next support target is EMA21 but we will skip it and go to EMA50 which sits at $46,000. So there will be a stop at the low 50Ks but this level is also likely to fast break.

The final level here is MA200 sitting at $34,000.

We can use Fib. retracements, price action, moving averages or any method we want, everything is pointing toward the same range in which we had a long accumulation phase in 2023, the one that lasted many months. This is the level/range that needs to be tested as support before Bitcoin can grow beyond $100,000+.

The fact that it was so hard for Bitcoin to break below 64-62K, means that this level will be a strong resistance on the way up. It will take some time to comeback but we will comeback and go even higher... Bitcoin is likely to trade above 70,000 in early 2025 and above 150,000 by May 2025.

Namaste."

üÖ±Ô∏è We Are Not Out Of The Danger Zone Yet!

When comparing today's situation with 2016, in relation to Bitcoin's halving event and the ensuing correction; let me tell you that we are not out of the ""danger-zone"" just yet, it is too early.

The danger zone, based on past history/data, lasts between 9-12 weeks after the halving, we are only four weeks into the current halving.

While in the past, 2016, a correction followed just a few weeks after the event, this doesn't mean that it needs to happen now in exactly the same way.

The projected recovery year in 2023 based on a comparison of the action we had in 2019, signaled the end of a bullish wave in Q3 2023 with prices between 50-60K, the end result was a bullish wave but the duration was quite different compared to past price action, it lasted so much more and prices went much higher than projected.

So just because the correction didn't happen right away, it doesn't mean that we are in the green just yet.

Just keep in mind the basics, Bitcoin is trading weekly below EMA10.

üëâ As long as Bitcoin trades below 72/74K, stay bearish. We are not out of the danger zone... Yet!

Thank you for reading.

AlanSantana,üÖ±Ô∏è Bitcoin Weekly Now Bearish,5,Initial post,1715624351.0,"For the first time coming out of a multi-year high, so, for the first time since April 2021, Bitcoin moved and closed weekly below EMA10.

üëâ Bitcoin is now officially trading within bearish territory.

This signal can be interpreted as the start of a short-term bearish wave. If the wave will be long or short in duration we cannot tell at this point; assuming our halving theory, bull-market, etc., we expect a short-term correction ‚Äîfast and strong followed by sustained growth but this is just speculation of course.

‚ûñ The truth is that Bitcoin moved completely different in this cycle compared to previous cycle.

‚ûñ The truth is that we are in uncharted territory, whoever gets it has done a good job at this point.

üëâ The correction can be mild or strong.

So far all signals continue to point toward a major crash in the coming days or weeks; it can always extend but the bearish signals are only becoming stronger, the bullish side weaker.

The feeling right now is as if there are no buyers... Waiting... Waiting for something; maybe the movement of some funds. Maybe the waiting is for some market participants to become complacent or maybe simply this is just how human psychology works.

There was plenty of time to sell at the top but for many this isn't enough... Right now we are going down and instead of securing amazing profits, some people are kind of greedy hoping for more.

All we can say is that Bitcoin will grow in the long-term... But short-term, prepare for the drop!

Namaste.

Bitcoin is leaving no room for doubt, the week starts red right away. We have political numbers coming out today and tomorrow but we know based on the chart what is likely the most scenario to develop.

The numbers will be ""good"" tomorrow, rejoice, party time yet somehow the markets will react in a negative way. So we will have positive expectations, positive news with mixed results.

Allow a few days for the effect to be noticeable and felt throughout the market. I say wait patiently until Friday or next week and the direction should be 100% clear by that point.

We continue 100% bearish on Bitcoin.
Do not be distracted by market noise.

The next move is likely to develop within days... It can break to either side of course but we are extremely bearish below 70K. And continue bearish on a SHORT basis below 74K. (If it moves above we turn bullish)

The levels can help you stay calm and clear doubts because there is always market noise.

The noise are moves within phases of the market cycle; for example, the trend is up but you get ""noise,"" prices moving up/down based on the buy/sell orders of varied market participants.

The noise we ignore, unless you are a scalper or day-trader, we focus on the trend.

We trade with the direction of the market.

‚ûñ The market turned bullish November 2022.
We turned bullish.

We go bullish until the bullish wave is almost over and start to prepare for a reversal; we've been doing this for years...

‚ûñ The market turned bearish March 2024.
We turned bearish.

We go bearish until the chart clearly shows a very strong reversal pattern or, the numbers mentioned above.

Stay clean, stay live, stay lovely, stay strong, stay safe...
Pray, breathe deeply, contemplate and meditate!

Whatever you do, comeback for more because we all make mistakes.
If something happened to you in the past that you do not like, do not be ashamed... We are all human beings and grow through mistakes.

Whatever happened yesterday helped us become what we are today.

And regardless if the experiences are good or bad, you will always deserve the best!

AlanSantana,üÖ±Ô∏è Bitcoin 2-4 Months... We Are Two Months In... Liquidity,2,Initial post,1715875928.0,"If the entire bearish wave takes a total of 4 months, we have only two months left before the whole move is completed. But the wave doesn't necessarily lasts 4 months, it can last 3 months or 6 months but not two. Can't be two because 14-March was the top and we are beyond 2 months already into the bearish wave.

Now, this is what I've been sharing with you for a while...
This is my understanding of the signals coming from the charts and market dynamics.

While this is technical analysis and truly focused mainly on the chart; fundamentals, sentiment, feelings, emotions, the stars (Astrology), related markets, geo-politics and the rest, are all considered for the final conclusion.

If Bitcoin produces a new bottom low now, it would still take months to recover.

Prices ""recovering"" and moving back up after a long-term higher low is extremely bullish.

Just as it can take 2 months to move from $74,000 to $60,000;
It can take 2-3 months to move from $30,000 to $60,000 (down from up) or more.

This is to say that it can take a while before Bitcoin moves to new highs if a major correction shows up.

This is still an ""if"" because even though I have a high level of confidence in my analysis, I can be completely wrong.

‚ûñ The fact that Bitcoin has been bearish for two months but still trades above 60K, can be considered a bullish signal. Other bullish factors such as the recent growth wave works against the bulls.

The market tends to fluctuate between down and up and thus strong bullish action has bearish potential at the top, while strong bearish action has bullish potential after a new low.

If Bitcoin turns bullish, we also turn bullish; that's for sure.

üëâ Bitcoin for us goes bullish above $74,000 on a daily basis, with confirmation needed on a weekly basis.

üëâ Any trading below 70,000 is ultra-bearish.

‚ûñ The longer Bitcoin trades below this level without challenging it, the weaker it becomes.
‚ûñ The longer Bitcoin fails to challenge the last high (ATH), the stronger the bearish bias and potential.

It is likely that Bitcoin will not grow next... Remember the expert, he said Bitcoin would range between 55-75K. This is not possible because the All-Time High is 74K.

You cannot range above the range and thus we know what comes next.

Ask yourself:

‚ûñ Where do these people get this information?
‚ûñ Is there anything to back such claim?

The fundamentals are great, yes; we all love Bitcoin but, the fundamentals is what pushed Bitcoin up to 74K. Now that the fundamentals wave is exhausted, the market moves the other way.

New players are desperate to join, I get messages everyday.
People want to buy Bitcoin but it is too expensive and the market wants them to play.

Remember the word ""liquidity"" ... Where is the liquid?

Where is the money?

Wherever the money is, that's where the energy will go.

Liquidity is down now and so... Down we go!
