Support and resistance zones are the key in trading. As long as we can stay above 0.60, XRP remains bullish. We are coiling up for a big move. Last weeks we are just ranging, the price doesn’t move much so prepare for the move…

I believe that once we can break the triangle formation and break the price of 1.20 we can see a new all time high. This triangle is forming since 2017.. The move that will be from there will be possible again as in 2017.

The question is, how many XRP traders are still left? Probably not much because all the sh*t has been around.

Do you still believe in XRP?

Let me know in the comment..

Have a great day!

Th monthly candle will end soon so it's time to check out what is going on.
Since July 2023 we are forming a very tight monthly range. Once we can break out this range a huge rally will follow.

The question is when will it happen? It's is still possible for XRP to continue this range for a few more months but at one time it will fly fast.

What else is notable? The way the XRPBTC chat looks, we are trying hard to form a bottom here. Even if the XRP pair will break lower, we will find a bottom and catch up fast.

History is repeating itself, we can find the same pattern again and again.
After a breakout we get a pullback and a retest of broken resistance. I would like to see XRP above 0.60 with the weekly candle close.

If XRP would follow the exact same pattern as in 2017 then we would reach 230 dollar for 1 XRP in 1 year of time. Then we would decline to 17 dollar in a time frame of 7 years. For those who bought the 230 dollar top, sits on a a bag with a serious loss. Will this happen? I don't know i'm just showing what history did in the past!

Get your popcorn ready because the weekly candle close is coming!
What's important? As i mentioned before, we need to hold 0.60 as it is a important support zone. If we can hold that level i believe we soon be on the 0.90 area!

If can not hold 0.60 we might fall to 0.53 and we see a longer range but in the end all targets remain the same!!

The same for the BTC pair, if we would fall 10% lower or not we are ready for a 200% rally upwards.

On the 4 H timeframe we can pay attention to the declining trendline.
If we can successfully can break above the targets are clear. If we reject we find support at the rising trendline.

Watch out for fake outs! We need to see a back test and continuation.

Xrp is playing tricks with our mind. Here we are again at 0.60 so since last week wen are still in the range. Next chart is upside down, it means if it goes down we go up..

Even if we would touch 0.53 we still would be extremely bullish. We are restesting crucial levels why the XRPBTC chart is ready to break out

In trading we need to adjust our focus all the time and look for patterns. Currently we are at support of a triangle formation. If we can hold this zone, a next possible target would be the resistance zone of the triangle at 0.61

compared to the BTC , XRP is printing 9 monthly bearish candles! We can expect at least a short squeeze soon and if we only would move to the 0.236 fib level we will bounce about 60% !

We are nearing a important level on. XRP ! We have a retest on the downtrending trendline and we are at resistance of the rising trendline.

If we can break above this trendline we can fly back to the 0.70 range.

From a weekly pov, it seems that next week will be important! It's also notable that tomorrow Ripple will reply in the SEC case. Will it be so positive for Ripple that XRP will move higher? By the look of the charts it seems so.

It's taking a lot of time but there is not much space left in the triangle formation.

If you see the current chart, what will you do? Go long or short? On this chart we are at major resistance so we would short right? Well this chart is upside down so actually we are at support. Sometimes when moving a chart upside down we get a better perspective.

Sometimes a line chart can give you more info and filter out the noice. As long as we can stay above 0.48 we most likely see 0.86 first!

As the weekly and the monthly candle almost coming to the close we need to pay attention to the chart! On the line chart we can see that we are still in a range and if we manage to stay above 0.48 we most likely will range back to the highs.

Once we can break out the range our target will be around 1.20.

Have a nice sunday

A few reason why i think XRP will be bullish in May:

The monthly chart is coming to a close and we are still in a sideways range.
We are printing a bullish hammer on the XRPBTC chart, after so many red weeks it's time to put in that big green candle!
We also are very oversold on the weekly chart, when the RSI go back above the 30 level it's time for fireworks.

Hello friends,


XRP is dropping again but you can not change the market cycles. In the following charts I will give you my thoughts on xrp and why I think we can reach 4 dollar in a not to far future.

First of all let’s check out data:

From December 2013 till march 2017 we were trending down, that was about 1200 days. After that we saw a 35000 % rise!

After the bullrun we again started the downtrend from January 2018 till December 2021, about 1113 days. We then went up 700%!

From 2021 till now about 1100 days we are moving slowly up but no real bullrun yet. This Is why I don’t mind holding for the real bull run! I expect XRP to see this run this year. My targets are between 4 and 7 dollar. I just measured the price if we went for a run for only 700%. iF we start a super cycle like in 2017 yeah then this 4 dollar is just the first wave.. But we stay realistic and see what brings us.

What also is interesting is the XRPBTC chart, let’s check out that data:

In a timeframe of 10 years we only touched the major demand zone (support) 4 times and now for the 5th! We bounced from there;

1700%
5000%
500%
500%

The question is how much will we bounce and when?
This nobody nows but I think we are getting close!

Hello Friends,

There might me a bullish pattern forming, a inverse head and shoulder.
If we measure the length from the neckline to the bottom it's about 12%. If we project 12% after a break of the neckline it will bring us back to the highs of 0.72.

Luck or technical analysis?

XRP is flirting with a very important support and resistance zone.

If we look at previous data we touched the 0.60 line many times and many times we went up from here fast.

A lot of people gave up on this coin because how it barely moves. But when it finally does it will pay off.

Major zones

0.81
0.91
1.22
