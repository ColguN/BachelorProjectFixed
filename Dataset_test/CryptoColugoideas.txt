Support and resistance zones are the key in trading. As long as we can stay above 0.60, XRP remains bullish. We are coiling up for a big move. Last weeks we are just ranging, the price doesn’t move much so prepare for the move…

I believe that once we can break the triangle formation and break the price of 1.20 we can see a new all time high. This triangle is forming since 2017.. The move that will be from there will be possible again as in 2017.

The question is, how many XRP traders are still left? Probably not much because all the sh*t has been around.

Do you still believe in XRP?

Let me know in the comment..

Have a great day!

Th monthly candle will end soon so it's time to check out what is going on.
Since July 2023 we are forming a very tight monthly range. Once we can break out this range a huge rally will follow.

The question is when will it happen? It's is still possible for XRP to continue this range for a few more months but at one time it will fly fast.

If XRP would follow the exact same pattern as in 2017 then we would reach 230 dollar for 1 XRP in 1 year of time. Then we would decline to 17 dollar in a time frame of 7 years. For those who bought the 230 dollar top, sits on a a bag with a serious loss. Will this happen? I don't know i'm just showing what history did in the past!

Get your popcorn ready because the weekly candle close is coming!
What's important? As i mentioned before, we need to hold 0.60 as it is a important support zone. If we can hold that level i believe we soon be on the 0.90 area!

If can not hold 0.60 we might fall to 0.53 and we see a longer range but in the end all targets remain the same!!

Xrp is playing tricks with our mind. Here we are again at 0.60 so since last week wen are still in the range. Next chart is upside down, it means if it goes down we go up..

Even if we would touch 0.53 we still would be extremely bullish. We are restesting crucial levels why the XRPBTC chart is ready to break out

As the weekly and the monthly candle almost coming to the close we need to pay attention to the chart! On the line chart we can see that we are still in a range and if we manage to stay above 0.48 we most likely will range back to the highs.

Once we can break out the range our target will be around 1.20.

Have a nice sunday

Hello friends,


XRP is dropping again but you can not change the market cycles. In the following charts I will give you my thoughts on xrp and why I think we can reach 4 dollar in a not to far future.

First of all let’s check out data:

From December 2013 till march 2017 we were trending down, that was about 1200 days. After that we saw a 35000 % rise!

After the bullrun we again started the downtrend from January 2018 till December 2021, about 1113 days. We then went up 700%!

From 2021 till now about 1100 days we are moving slowly up but no real bullrun yet. This Is why I don’t mind holding for the real bull run! I expect XRP to see this run this year. My targets are between 4 and 7 dollar. I just measured the price if we went for a run for only 700%. iF we start a super cycle like in 2017 yeah then this 4 dollar is just the first wave.. But we stay realistic and see what brings us.

What also is interesting is the XRPBTC chart, let’s check out that data:

In a timeframe of 10 years we only touched the major demand zone (support) 4 times and now for the 5th! We bounced from there;

1700%
5000%
500%
500%

The question is how much will we bounce and when?
This nobody nows but I think we are getting close!

Hello Friends,

There might me a bullish pattern forming, a inverse head and shoulder.
If we measure the length from the neckline to the bottom it's about 12%. If we project 12% after a break of the neckline it will bring us back to the highs of 0.72.

Luck or technical analysis?

XRP is flirting with a very important support and resistance zone.

If we look at previous data we touched the 0.60 line many times and many times we went up from here fast.

A lot of people gave up on this coin because how it barely moves. But when it finally does it will pay off.

Major zones

0.81
0.91
1.22

I think we will see a green weekend for the crypto market. Specially for ALTCOINS!

After a break of the downward channel we are now testing support and are possible creating a bullish pattern, a inverse head and shoulder pattern.

Have a good weekend.

This is the inverse XRPUSD chart so upside down.
We broke a major triangle formation to the downside (bullish) and we are now retesting the broken support zone.

XRP is still bullish and the short term targets are 0.81 and 0.91.
We are in a bullmarket and dips are for buying. (IMO)

Let's take a look at the XRP chart starting with the monthly timeframe.

We are forming a very tight range with lower highs and higher lows. If we can see a break of 0.75 we can reach following targets:

0.81
0.93
1.11
1.59

Now let's check out the weekly chart.

We broke the major declining trendline and touched the first horizontal support.

Comment:
Let's dive in the daily chart.

After a 20% move up the RSI was in the overbought zone and need to cool of. For now we saw 3 inside bars so we are creating a tight range, this ranges often awaiting a big move. Till now it seems we are forming a bull flag. This can continue to the upside.

As mentioned in my previous idea we broke the 0.60 resistance area and we had a retest of the broken zone! IF we can hold this level i expect us to move towards 0.71 before a pullback.

The XRPBTC is a historical levels and are nearing major support levels. A reversal will happen soon and i believe XRP willl finally have it's run.
Mar 1
Comment:
XRP is testing a very important level the 0.60 area. Look at the chart below and look how it acted as major resistance and support! With the next major break i believe we can fly to 0.85. It's a + 45% raise!

The XRPBTC chart looks great. Risk to reward this is what you want to see.
Since 2014 we only touched the green box (major support) only 5 times! we are in this zone again and the RSI is below 30 on the weekly chart. We are setting up for a huge raise! Don't sleep on XRP. Don't chase coins that already went up a lot of %, search the ones that didn't yet!

This the XRPBTC chart on the weekly. If we can close the weekly candle like this we are making a bullish hammer. The last time the RSI was below 30 on the weekly chart we made a +158% move! Let's see what happens coming week but i think a big move for XRP is on the horizon.

Update:

Check out the XRPBTC monthly chart. We have 7 bearish candles without any lower high, just straight lows compared to bitcoin! Soon the game will change and XRP will catch up. In 2017 we formed a double bottom and went though the roof! Are we creating again a double bottom? I think so and i see a realistic move towards the supply zone. This will be a + 140% move what will bring XRP around 1 dollar.

Here are the targets and major resistance:

0.91

That's the minimum i think, if you look at what happened in 2017 i think everything is possible but this are realistic numbers.

XRP broke the diagonal trendline and creating a triangle formation. I think we will next visit the resistance area around 0.60, then we can revisit the lows around 0.54 and then we probably can see a break towards 0.72.

XRP is currently testing major resistance on the daily chart. We saw that this zone rejected price for many times in the past. We also saw that once we can break this zone price is moving up fast.

I would only be interested in a long position if we can break this strong resistance.

If we can break resistance the target point would be 0.60 and if fit fails we watch out for a daily higher low to be set, if we can't manage to set a daily higher low price probably drop to the next important demand zone of the 0.47.

Enjoy your sunday.
