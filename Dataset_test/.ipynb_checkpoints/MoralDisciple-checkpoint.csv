The Four Phases of an #Altcoin Bull Market

i) Accumulation : This is where price bottoms out after a long bear market. Prices consolidate and break the downtrend during this period.

ii) First Leg up : Here, prices begin to surge, but many retail investors fail to recognize the trend change, leading them to stay on the sidelines.

iii) Chop : After the first leg up, prices often move sideways, entering a choppy phase, you can also call it a re-accumulation phase after the first leg up, commonly observed after the Bitcoin halving.

iv) Up Only : This is where most of the money is made in a very short period of time, Bitcoin, Altcoins, memecoins everything goes parabolic during this phase.

If you pay attention to the chart, the first three phases typically progress slowly and can be somewhat boring at times, but the real profits are made by positioning oneself in these initial phases.

Impatient individuals who chase after red and green candles are likely to get caught out during the first three phases.

In the final phase, crypto dominates the news, attracting new money, and both Bitcoin and altcoins reach new all time highs.

This is when smart money & early buyers starts unloading their holdings, while retail investors believe the rally will continue indefinitely.
We are on the third stage and the fourth is coming soon!!! Only up!!!"

I looked at the timing on the weekly chart to see how long the wave took. It is interesting that it is also surprisingly similar.
The previous BS lasted 19 weeks and today's 20 weeks
The previous BS cooling lasted 6 weeks and today's 6 weeks (strong volume).
(Small volume) The previous BS cooling area lasted 10w and today's is confirmed on June 3rd and then it will be 7 weeks.

With this, we could assume that we have a few weeks until the pump.
Of course, this is only a guess and the actual one may differ, but still, everything is incredibly similar wow"

Extreme.
Going to even smaller charts and comparing the previous BS cooling, there are similarities again.
Psyche works almost exactly the same for this coin as last time, only the volume is different. Indicators in daily use helped to compare comfortably.
I have a feeling that we can take the ada coin as an index to better understand other coins in the market.
Of course, the situation can change, but I'll be watching closely to see if it continues in a similar way in the future.

Previous BS cooling -51.2% and today -50.6%(BINANCE ADAUSDT) Cooling is the same"

I looked at the rsi on the weekly chart and compared it to the previous cooling. The comparison is justified, because almost everything is the same, only the difference in volume
The SPU also happened last time, which I am waiting for today. I assume this because of the price pattern, and it's nice to see that last time was the same.

Based on this comparison, it can be assumed that this week will close in green

SPU in late June would be ideal and we could open the new quarter with a support point and then only upupupupupup

Create a logical circle and achieve success with your favorite coin. I only support super popular coins and don't waste my time with new coins (sometimes out of boredom I also look at new ones, but that's just a pastime).

I'm assuming if you're looking for new coins you'll get maybe 10x more profit than the popular ones? You are stupid and naive, in reality you risk much more.
Popular coins that are not at risk of scams can be traded with leverage. If you analyze well, you will earn 10x more profit with popular coins.
You only need to worry about understanding the price pattern, not whether this coin will ever achieve anything."

The Four Phases of an #Altcoin Bull Market

i) Accumulation : This is where price bottoms out after a long bear market. Prices consolidate and break the downtrend during this period.

ii) First Leg up : Here, prices begin to surge, but many retail investors fail to recognize the trend change, leading them to stay on the sidelines.

iii) Chop : After the first leg up, prices often move sideways, entering a choppy phase, you can also call it a re-accumulation phase after the first leg up, commonly observed after the Bitcoin halving.

iv) Up Only : This is where most of the money is made in a very short period of time, Bitcoin, Altcoins, memecoins everything goes parabolic during this phase.

If you pay attention to the chart, the first three phases typically progress slowly and can be somewhat boring at times, but the real profits are made by positioning oneself in these initial phases.

Impatient individuals who chase after red and green candles are likely to get caught out during the first three phases.

In the final phase, crypto dominates the news, attracting new money, and both Bitcoin and altcoins reach new all time highs.

This is when smart money & early buyers starts unloading their holdings, while retail investors believe the rally will continue indefinitely.
We are on the third stage and the fourth is coming soon!!! Only up!!!"

Matic tells us what the market situation of other coins will be in the near future.

A 30% drop is not surprising, we exist in a pyramid scheme, this is normal.

I have no doubts about my analysis as it has achieved a large factual logical circle. I mean the drop before the big rise.

* Its volume has increased too much in timing.
*Price has risen and closed green candles on the monthly chart for 7 months in a row. This has never happened before.
* Volume levels are high, volume low and volume high, we call it abc.
*Stfmodel arithmetic calculation of the halving area says 50% drop, I'm just expecting max 30% drop now, common thing in crypto.

The fact is that btc will fall below 59400k, if you don't understand this, you are manipulated by opinion.
Questions for yourself today:
At what level does the decline stop? is it 55k? or more?
Does btc do price pattern abc or osd (osd-extra fast abc)? OSD would be great, but...
Time will give the real answers.

The light blue assumed price pattern is illustrative!!! It is naive to believe that this is exactly what will happen.

****Summary: I will wait for 55-57k and see if the indicators and price pattern are good **OR NOT**. I remember stf model calculation(You can find it in update1 analysis), time will tell us the real truth****

Analyzing *Step by step* successfully leads to truth and profit.


I rule out 100% strong upside from the 70k area because I know what I'm doing.
*if btc goes above 73700k x% it will drop back down*

On the three-week chart, the candle closes in the red and opens a new one on April 15.
All this is necessary, otherwise there will be bloodshed in the summer, but I don't believe it.

History will not help you today if you copy in a simplistic way.
btc is still in the 70k area and nothing has changed, it's a delay(75k(which is possible) doesn't make me strongly bullish)"

Today it is wise to follow MATIC, ADA, ETH and BTC with analysis

Create a logical circle and achieve success with your favorite coin. I only support super popular coins and don't waste my time with new coins (sometimes out of boredom I also look at new ones, but that's just a pastime).

I'm assuming if you're looking for new coins you'll get maybe 10x more profit than the popular ones? You are stupid and naive, in reality you risk much more.
Popular coins that are not at risk of scams can be traded with leverage. If you analyze well, you will earn 10x more profit with popular coins.
You only need to worry about understanding the price pattern, not whether this coin will ever achieve anything."

Touching the yellow area with a big logical circle is not likely, because altcoins say so.

In March, I didn't know that btc would stay at the same level and altcoins would fall. I thought that btc and altcoins will fall almost similarly.

Whether btc goes up to 75k or not doesn't matter to me. It is more important for me that btc is below the yellow line (risk line)."

When I say that today altcoins and bitcoin are not in a logical circle, it is aimed at the analysis that shows a drop of 57k minimum. Altcoins have made their main decline, but btc did not fall to a minimum of 57k (initially I assumed that btc at a minimum of 57k will bring altcoins to the level where they are now). If I stick with my altcoin analysis, btc won't fall 57k. Personally, I would like to believe that btc will not fall to a minimum of 57k, which will keep a logical circle. The logical circle is due to my personal analysis results, and the change of one side must be logical with the other side.

One commenter sees that there is nothing logical about bitcoin and altcoins anymore, I wouldn't be surprised if he only knows how to copy history and has brain cancer.
Altcoins are low it is obvious and still in reaccumulation area. What hint do altcoins give to Bitcoin? Bitcoin is still in reaccumulation area and today's rise to 70k may be deceptive. Next year 250k or even more depending on what level we see at the end of this year."

The Four Phases of an #Altcoin Bull Market

i) Accumulation : This is where price bottoms out after a long bear market. Prices consolidate and break the downtrend during this period.

ii) First Leg up : Here, prices begin to surge, but many retail investors fail to recognize the trend change, leading them to stay on the sidelines.

iii) Chop : After the first leg up, prices often move sideways, entering a choppy phase, you can also call it a re-accumulation phase after the first leg up, commonly observed after the Bitcoin halving.

iv) Up Only : This is where most of the money is made in a very short period of time, Bitcoin, Altcoins, memecoins everything goes parabolic during this phase.

If you pay attention to the chart, the first three phases typically progress slowly and can be somewhat boring at times, but the real profits are made by positioning oneself in these initial phases.

Impatient individuals who chase after red and green candles are likely to get caught out during the first three phases.

In the final phase, crypto dominates the news, attracting new money, and both Bitcoin and altcoins reach new all time highs.

This is when smart money & early buyers starts unloading their holdings, while retail investors believe the rally will continue indefinitely."

I have doubts, the candle closes red and a new candle opens on July 1st and closes green on October 1st.

I closed the previous analysis in such a way that I believed that April would be in the red, and maybe even May. So far I haven't been wrong

I like my original May-June time prediction, in other words June 1st. If I see a BS earlier before June 1st, I'll probably assign it to SPD.

If you think this candle closes green, good luck and hope I'm wrong.

Yes, I may be wrong, but I believe my truth.
In the big picture I am extremely bullish, I liken Bitcoin to the new S&P that was built to grow forever, as long as we exist.

*Bitcoin will not fall around 50k (Today there is no evidence that 50k will come)
*Bitcoin's correction also lasts in May, until June.
*First real BS markings in June.
*May rises fall back
*Bitcoin is below 73k on July 1st.

The Four Phases of an #Altcoin Bull Market

i) Accumulation : This is where price bottoms out after a long bear market. Prices consolidate and break the downtrend during this period.

ii) First Leg up : Here, prices begin to surge, but many retail investors fail to recognize the trend change, leading them to stay on the sidelines.

iii) Chop : After the first leg up, prices often move sideways, entering a choppy phase, you can also call it a re-accumulation phase after the first leg up, commonly observed after the Bitcoin halving.

iv) Up Only : This is where most of the money is made in a very short period of time, Bitcoin, Altcoins, memecoins everything goes parabolic during this phase.

If you pay attention to the chart, the first three phases typically progress slowly and can be somewhat boring at times, but the real profits are made by positioning oneself in these initial phases.

Impatient individuals who chase after red and green candles are likely to get caught out during the first three phases.

In the final phase, crypto dominates the news, attracting new money, and both Bitcoin and altcoins reach new all time highs.

This is when smart money & early buyers starts unloading their holdings, while retail investors believe the rally will continue indefinitely.
I've already shared this once, but let's remind you of the situation. Where are we? We are on the third stage and the fourth is coming soon!!!"

Hmm the indicators didn't lie, btc is looking for support to make new highs. This support is nothing special considering BTC -x%.
Let's see what happens if btc makes an ideal support point or not"

I'm bullish on the big but what's happening on the small chart. I could be wrong
If BTC sees 71k, I'm automatically EXTRA BULLISH"

If the rsi is green before red, then it's harder for me to understand and I have to create a new logic. Today I'm waiting for red and if it's green I'll review the situation again"

It is ideal if the BBS happens soon. tomorrow could also be green, then good
The reality is that tomorrow is a red day, but we hope not haha.
I am in favor of the increase, but soon we will see the truth.

It would be nice if it only rise and rise, but what is reality?
A drop below the yellow line is likely and fib 0.382 could be the minimum drop.
Next 66k or 64k, I assume"

btc is really good and is much better than I expected
If we look at macd, it wants to cross up soon, but if this crossing is correct, then there is one positive news, btc will not fall below the white line and will not fall below 66.5k.
72k+ would be ideal soon, let's see what happens. extremely excited
Altcoins will probably not show a special result this month, but it would be good if btc is better than altcoins this month. Gives a good probability that altcoins will pump ultra strongly after the quarter change."

It doesn't even make sense to hope that btc will get cheaper x%. NO ONE WANTS TO SELL
And it is not likely that btc will fall below 60k. There is no other direction, only up, the main one is just starting AND NOW!!"
