CryptoColugo,XRPUSD - Target 2024 - between 4 and 7 dollar.,4,Initial post,1713425947.0,"Hello friends,


XRP is dropping again but you can not change the market cycles. In the following charts I will give you my thoughts on xrp and why I think we can reach 4 dollar in a not to far future.

First of all let’s check out data:

From December 2013 till march 2017 we were trending down, that was about 1200 days. After that we saw a 35000 % rise!

After the bullrun we again started the downtrend from January 2018 till December 2021, about 1113 days. We then went up 700%!

From 2021 till now about 1100 days we are moving slowly up but no real bullrun yet. This Is why I don’t mind holding for the real bull run! I expect XRP to see this run this year. My targets are between 4 and 7 dollar. I just measured the price if we went for a run for only 700%. iF we start a super cycle like in 2017 yeah then this 4 dollar is just the first wave.. But we stay realistic and see what brings us.

What also is interesting is the XRPBTC chart, let’s check out that data:

In a timeframe of 10 years we only touched the major demand zone (support) 4 times and now for the 5th! We bounced from there;

1700%
5000%
500%
500%

The question is how much will we bounce and when?
This nobody nows but I think we are getting close!"

CryptoColugo,XRPUSD - Patience for that 100% move Up,1,Initial post,1711230031.0,"Hello Friends,

There might me a bullish pattern forming, a inverse head and shoulder.
If we measure the length from the neckline to the bottom it's about 12%. If we project 12% after a break of the neckline it will bring us back to the highs of 0.72.

Luck or technical analysis?"
CryptoColugo,XRPUSD - Patience for that 100% move Up,11,Update post 1,1710786335.0,"XRP is flirting with a very important support and resistance zone.

If we look at previous data we touched the 0.60 line many times and many times we went up from here fast.

A lot of people gave up on this coin because how it barely moves. But when it finally does it will pay off.

Major zones

0.81
0.91
1.22"

XRP is still bullish and the short term targets are 0.81 and 0.91.
We are in a bullmarket and dips are for buying. (IMO)"

Let's dive in the daily chart.

After a 20% move up the RSI was in the overbought zone and need to cool of. For now we saw 3 inside bars so we are creating a tight range, this ranges often awaiting a big move. Till now it seems we are forming a bull flag. This can continue to the upside."

Since 2014 we only touched the green box (major support) only 5 times! we are in this zone again and the RSI is below 30 on the weekly chart. We are setting up for a huge raise! Don't sleep on XRP. Don't chase coins that already went up a lot of %, search the ones that didn't yet!"

Update:

Check out the XRPBTC monthly chart. We have 7 bearish candles without any lower high, just straight lows compared to bitcoin! Soon the game will change and XRP will catch up. In 2017 we formed a double bottom and went though the roof! Are we creating again a double bottom? I think so and i see a realistic move towards the supply zone. This will be a + 140% move what will bring XRP around 1 dollar."

Here are the targets and major resistance:

0.91
