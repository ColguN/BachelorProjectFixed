without_worries,Bitcoin - Have we just witnessed a massive shakeout?,4,Initial post,1713392079.0,"There has been a few enquires on how much further price action will fall. I don’t know.
However I'm a data scientist and that means I like looking for patterns.

There’s a lot interesting confluence at the moment at the same time most of tradingview.com is publishing “short” ideas and yet from a quick scan of the ideas shared I've not seen many ask the question:

Why was price action arrested just shy of sixty thousand dollars?

On the above daily chart two flag patterns are shown. Actually I should say one, because there is some very intriguing facts about those flags, and that is:

1) The angle of each flag is exactly the same, 172 degrees. In other words the candlestick touch points of the previous flag are mirrored by the second without deviation. Coincidence?

2) Lower test points, exactly 42 bars part. From the first to the last exactly 42 days came to pass. And what is the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything is?

42


3) If the same touchpoint theory is used for the upper touch points then price action breaks out of the upper flag around May 10th to continue its journey to $110-120k.

without_worries,"Litecoin (LTC), imminent collapse to $30?",18,Initial post,1701115082.0,"And possibly below $10 after that?

Most if not all Alt-tokens have returned to their 2017 lows with 95% to 98% corrections since 2021. Pick any token popular at that time:

1) DASH.. 95% correction with a return to $25 in 2023 as it was in 2017. Inflation adjusted, the price should be $19! A bucket of expired sardines in a Norwegian Fish-market has gained more value.

2) XLM -90%
3) HBAR -95%
4) ADA -95%
5) NEO -95%
6) ETH -75% (massively bearish still!)
7) SOL -96%

It is everywhere you look, 95% corrections are all over.

Currently Litecoin is at an 85% correction. 95% takes price action to $15. Inflation adjusted, less than $10.

The technical analysis also supports the outlook. On the above 10 day chart:

a) A significant trend-line support has broken (orange line). Over the last 10 years Litecoin has enjoyed a continuous uptrend. The support has now failed AND confirmed. Yes price action could rally to $130-140, the bulls would get excited. Regardless, breaking this confirmed resistance will not be easy.

b) The 2nd bear flag breakout. It has confirmed. A 70% correction from the exit point measures to $28.

c) If support at $28 does not confirm, the next support is just under $10, the full 95% correction like everything else.

Is it possible price action continues sideways? Sure.
Is it probable? No.

After 1029 days price action breaks through resistance. A status many alt tokens achieved over a year ago. What happens next is unlikely to be surprising.

With a new month new data prints. The downtrend in price action confirmed with the monthly Gaussian channel changing to red for the very first time.

Focus on the blue arrows. Regardless of stock, crypto, whatever asset you study a confirmation of support or resistance on the mid line Gaussian channel shall with high probability result in a strong move to test the upper or lower side of the channel.

As such, price action has confirmed resistance from the mid-line. The lower lower channel rests on $30 at this time. However just like the upper side tests with continuation there is no guarantee price action stops its descent after breaking $30.

There’s been so many strong and clear indications of a strong reversal throughout this ideas and yet the resistance to it is as equally strong. Emotions are a money killer."

without_worries,Cardano (ADA) 70% macro correction to 15 cents?,6,Initial post,1712495990.0,"On the “Alt-coin market preparing for a 10x move” idea from July 2023 (below) it was written:

“A word of warning. The uptrend will not be equal across all alt-tokens, I'm quite certain of that. Throwing a wide net out across the market will not work as in 2017, you've got to be selective.”

Legacy token holders are slowly coming to the realisation this was not hyperbole. LTC, MATIC, ALGO, you name it, legacy tokens are underperforming. ADA is now added to the list of tokens set to show significant underperformance for the remainder of this bull market.

On the above weekly chart ADA price action has confirmed significant negative divergence across 8 oscillators as measured over a 2 month period. Just as it was in March 2021. Look left!!

In addition to the divergence price action has confirmed legacy support as resistance. It does not get much more bearish than this. But it does… The ADA / Bitcoin ratio..

The ADA.btc pair has confirmed resistance following a confirmed break of market structure. This is not indicative of other tokens currently over performing in the space.

Is it possible price action see higher highs? For sure.
Is it probable? No.

Had a few messages asking is the idea still valid, or why is it so slow to move? Others are popping off etc..

This token is up around 20% since publication. It has a market capital of 7 billion dollars. It will take a serious Tsunami of cash to move price action to target, it will not happen quickly.

Laterally, it is worth focusing on network effects when studying such large market caps. Especially when the market cap exceeds many companies listed on the S&P 500 and NASDAQ. There are many companies in the world that produce meaningful products and services with tens of thousands of customers with the same market cap. Dot has very few users be comparison, very few.

2) Price action is at resistance after three years of consolidation. This is the third test of resistance. Blue pointing down arrows.
