Xanrox,Bitcoin - historical bull trap! + Name your altcoin,8,Initial post,1717655486.0,"Make sure you prepare for this huge historical bullish trap on Bitcoin. Why? First, look at the price action. We have a bullish flag, that's what everyone sees. The market makers count every cent on their accounts, and this is a pretty good opportunity for them to make a lot of money by trapping retail traders. What will a typical retail trader do in this situation? Probably buy/long BTC at around 71k to 75k. That's where the whales step in and start selling, sending BTC back to 63k!

Why 63k? This is a strong support because we have an unfilled FVGAP + Point of control (POC) of the previous market structure. I really don't see any bullish sentiment during the summer season, as statistically, Bitcoin has been going sideways. 

From the Elliott Wave perspective, we are in wave 5 of the first impulse wave, which is of course very bullish for the long-term, but buying at the end of wave 5 is probably not a good idea. What successful traders generally do is wait for an ABC corrective pattern to form before buying.

Important update: Bitcoin is crashing very dramatically! The key trendline is breaking down! I am receiving a lot of questions about what is going to happen now? What is the next support?"
Xanrox,"Bitcoin - 300,000 USD by 2025, here is why!",7,Initial post,1717141836.0,"There is almost no doubt that Bitcoin will continue in the bull market in 2024/2025. After the ETF approval, Bitcoin is going up as institutional investors gain confidence in this type of investment. But what all people want to know is when to sell Bitcoin and prepare for the next bear market. Bitcoin's bear markets are very devastating, and the usual correction is around 80% - 70% from the peak. That's why it's good to time a good exit point if you are a trader. If you are a hodler, then you probably have your bitcoin in a Trezor hardware wallet and you don't care about volatility, even though it's not nice to see that your portfolio is down by 70%.

To determine the exit point, we need to use technical analysis on a weekly/monthly scale. In the chart, you can see price action in recent years and all these swings during previous bear markets. We can draw a massive ascending parallel channel and take a look at the market cycles. Selling at the top of the upward-sloping trendline is definitely a good idea, but will Bitcoin offer this opportunity? Sometimes markets turn bearish just before key levels. 

From a time perspective, October or September 2025 seems like the right time to sell Bitcoin and go into fiat or stable coins. Then buy again, cheaper after the crash. The 2021 peak is a strong level, and Bitcoin should never go below this level. I think Bitcoin volatility should decrease, and we should not see tremendous crashes anymore, but a 50% or 60% crash is something that is definitely very likely. Forget about 80% or 90% of the crashes that happened in 2015 or 2018.

This chart is a representation of the logarithmic scale. If you switch to a classic linear scale, we get a target for the whole bull market of only around 130,000 USD. I will do a linear scale representation in one of the next analyses, so make sure you follow my account so you don't miss this very important analysis!

On May 31, 69,000 Bitcoin options worth $4.7 billion and 920,000 Ether options worth $3.5 billion expire. The expiry of crypto options contracts is historically linked to price volatility in the crypto market.

According to the Deribit data, the put/call ratio for the expired Bitcoin options is 0.61. This means more calls (or long contracts) are expiring than puts (or shorts). On the other hand, Ether options had a put/call ratio of 0.46.

The put/call ratio (PCR) is a technical indicator that reflects trader market sentiment. A PCR below 0.7 is considered a strong bullish sentiment, while a PCR above 1 is considered a strong bearish sentiment."

Xanrox,"Bitcoin - 10% crash is coming, buy at 62k (here's why)",8,Initial post,1716967352.0,"Bitcoin is preparing for a pretty significant crash (in June). Why do I think so? We need to look at the previous price action because in May, Bitcoin pumped by 25%. If we take a look at May's price action, we can see that the uptrend created a FVGAP at 62k, and these gaps tend to be filled sooner rather than later. This is, of course, not the only reason why I am bearish. 

From the Elliott Wave perspective, Bitcoin finished the first impulse wave (1) and after such move we can expect a corrective ABC pattern because markets always move in waves. In general, a typical retracement for waves (1) is 0.618 FIB and also 0.382 FIB in strong bull markets. The 0.618 FIB overlays perfectly with the mentioned FVGAP, which gives us a pretty solid buying opportunity if the price reaches this level. The next good opportunity is to short Bitcoin on the futures market. 

The next reason why I am bearish is this small red trendline. As you can see, the trendline is breaking down, which is, of course, a sign of weakness. This trendline is part of the rising wedge pattern, so it adds to the overall bearishness. Currently, I am bearish, so be careful during the summer as the price action is not the most volatile for Bitcoin during this season.

Xanrox,Bitcoin - New all time high soon! (Follow this channel),18,Initial post,1716107966.0,"Bitcoin is breaking out of the bear market structure and creating a new uptrend that will lead to an all-time high! This thesis is supported by the fact that after the halving event, Bitcoin always goes up (statistically, 100% probability). The halving event took place 1 month ago and cut the reward for mines by half. It's recommended to trade with the trend to increase the probability of success in your trades.

From a technical perspective, Bitcoin has been moving in the ascending parallel channel, so you can definitely take advantage of that and buy/sell Bitcoin at the upward sloping trendlines! With TradingView, you can set an alert, and when it hits, you will get notified. 

What are the resistances on the way up? As I mentioned, the upward-sloping trendline of the parallel ascending channel is the first one. The second one is the FAIR VALUE GAP (FVGAP) which was created in April 2024. Usually, the start of the GAP and the end of the GAP are strong levels by themselves. You can use these levels for your short-term trades with leverage. These resistances Bitcoin needs to break before a continuation to a new all-time high; I don't see any other significant levels worth mentioning. Always choose the strongest levels to increase the probability of success.

I am bullish on Bitcoin, and I believe we will see prices above 100k in Q3/Q4 2024. Let me know in the comment section - are you still waiting for a big crash to buy the dip?

What now? Will this pump continue? It's possible, but I am waiting for lower prices because the current pump has created a huge FVGAP on the daily chart. These GAPS tend to be filled sooner rather than later. What's more, the price hit a critical point of resistance that you can see on the chart. We have 2 parallel channels, and the price is currently at this critical point. My suggestion is to wait for lower prices, 68k seems to be a strong support, but also the bottom of the ascending blue parallel channel.

Bitcoin is very bullish on the weekly chart, so there is a strong probability of prices above 100K this year. What is my ultimate target for Bitcoin for the whole bull market?

Xanrox,"Bitcoin - Life time opportunity, buy now, new ATH soon!",11,Initial post,1714727196.0,"Bitcoin is forming this bullish flag pattern on the daily chart, and we have a lifetime opportunity to buy Bitcoin at the bottom of the flag. What's more, we have a long-term trendline starting in October 2023, which is another reason to buy Bitcoin in confluence with multiple technical indicators. A lot of people are calling for Bitcoin winter, but I don't think so. I see the recent price action as a great buying opportunity on the other side. 

It is always important to do an Elliott Wave technical analysis to see the full picture. From my point of view, Bitcoin has formed and completed the WXYXZ triple-three corrective pattern inside this bullish flag. What you want to do as a trader is trade a breakout above the flag or buy at the bottom of the flag, potentially trading a breakout of the last Z wave.

Another reason why I think Bitcoin is bottoming out is the chart of Ethereum. This is probably one of the best indicators for Bitcoin, so we cannot miss doing analysis on it. You can check out my analysis of ETH in one of my previous posts, but I can tell you now that the crash was pretty strong (more than 30%) and we are in a bull market, so we definitely want to buy the DIP and prepare for another huge wave to the upside.

Xanrox,Bitcoin - new ATH soon. Best time to buy now,8,Initial post,1715071365.0,"Bitcoin looks very strong at this moment. We can see that the price is breaking out of the descending parallel channel on the daily chart. The price is above the channel and has already retested the downward-sloping trendline. We should see a strong pump from the current price. 

Why is bitcoin pumping? From a technical perspective, it's pretty easy to say. Take a look at the previous price action. We have a false breakout below the key levels; it was a bear trap created by market makers to get as much liquidity as possible for their huge orders, as they cannot simply do so whenever they want. 

From the Elliott Wave perspective, there is nothing bearish at this moment. I see that the corrective pattern WXYXZ has been completed, and we are starting a brand new impulse wave to the upside. The next target is around 71k because we have his important red trendline, so make sure you are aware of it.

Xanrox,"Bitcoin - Ultimate bottom will be here, but now 13% crash!",2,Initial post,1715676697.0,"The price action of Bitcoin is relatively boring on the higher time frames, why is that? The answer to this question may be that summer is almost here, and statistically, Bitcoin has been going sideways pretty much every summer. Usually, the fun begins in August/September, when the volatility comes into the market. 

What can we expect from Bitcoin in the following weeks? I am expecting a 13% crash because we need to hit the major red trendline on the daily chart. This trendline should hold the price of Bitcoin to the end of the bull market, so you want to buy every touch of it! We also have a 200-daily moving average that is currently pretty much at the same price as the mentioned trendline. The 200-MA is considered a strong dynamic support or resistance from huge institutions and hedge funds, so you definitely want to keep an eye on it. 

The price of Bitcoin is inside the bullish flag pattern, as you can see on the chart. This is a pretty strong confluence with the trendline to buy cheaper Bitcoin. Right now, I am bearish and expecting lower prices in the next few days and weeks. The bulls still need to show more strength before I can turn bullish. The best option seems to be to be patient and buy at the touch of the major red trendline! You can also place a high-leverage trade here if you trade futures.

On the 1h chart, Bitcoin is forming a head and shoulders pattern. I am expecting another crash soon!"
Xanrox,Bitcoin is ready to reach 70k! Here is why.,1,Initial post,1715328292.0,"Bitcoin has finished its corrective pattern (ABC ZigZag) and is ready to go higher. My next target is 70k (69577) because we have a 1:1 FIB extension level at this price. Usually this Fibo level is pretty significant; that's why I am expecting a small crash from it, but after that, we should continue much higher, to the 1.618 FIB extension. Of course, we need more information and data to precisely establish long-term targets. 

On the chart, we can see 2 parallel channels, the first is larger than the second. The larger one is still valid as the price is inside it, so we can use this knowledge to our advantage and potentially sell/short Bitcoin at the touch of the upper sloping trendline of the ascending parallel channel. But not now, Bitcoin is bullish, so enjoy the ride! 

From the Elliott Wave perspective, I also have to be bullish because I see the dream setup of every Elliott Wave trader. What you want to do is catch the 3rd impulse wave and ride it until the end before the 4th corrective wave occurs. Basically, you want to trade a breakout of the 2nd wave or catch the bottom of the 2nd wave with the Fibonacci retracement tool.
