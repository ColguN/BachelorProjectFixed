RocketBomb,Is Bitcoin Preparing for a Bull Run?,2,Initial post,1718130932.0,"Hello, dear friends!💙 Bitcoin has started to show a decline in price, even though other markets are experiencing growth.

Despite the current price decline, Bitcoin's behavior closely mirrors the patterns observed before previous bull runs. Analyzing historical data, we can see that Bitcoin often undergoes a phase of consolidation and accumulation before significant upward movements. This phase is characterized by narrowing price ranges and reduced volatility, often forming technical patterns like triangles or flags on the charts.

One of the key indicators suggesting a potential bull run is the breakout from these consolidation patterns. In the past, when Bitcoin has broken out of a well-defined triangle or flag pattern, it has often led to substantial price increases. Currently, we are observing similar behavior, where Bitcoin appears to be consolidating and forming a base of support. This base-building is crucial as it allows for the accumulation of buying pressure, which can propel prices higher when a breakout occurs.

It's important to acknowledge that Bitcoin's current decline could be part of the larger consolidation phase, potentially shaking out weak hands and setting the stage for a more robust recovery. Such pullbacks are not uncommon and can often precede stronger bullish momentum as the market stabilizes and regains confidence.


Moreover, market sentiment and external factors play a crucial role in the development of a bull run. Positive news, regulatory clarity, or institutional adoption can act as catalysts, driving investor confidence and increasing buying activity. With the macroeconomic environment showing signs of stability and other markets experiencing growth, Bitcoin's current consolidation phase might just be the calm before the storm.

Pay attention to the price formations I've circled in yellow and pink, and notice how the price reacted afterwards.


In conclusion, while Bitcoin is currently seeing a price decline, its behavior still exhibits patterns that have historically preceded bull runs. If this trend continues and we see a confirmed breakout from the current consolidation phase, it could signal the start of another significant upward movement. Investors should keep a close eye on key support and resistance levels, as well as external market factors, to position themselves advantageously for the potential bull run.

Thanks for Your attention and interest in my work.

RocketBomb,BTC $ 255 000 this BULL RUN?,2,Initial post,1708698888.0,"Hello, everyone!💥

Today, let's talk about Bitcoin and its prospects for the coming years. What should we expect? Let's compare the two previous bull runs.

To start with, every four years, the reward for Bitcoin miners decreases, a phenomenon known as halving.

Why is everyone so waiting for halving? Well, when the next halving occurs, miners receive half the rewards, reducing the speed of new Bitcoin mining and consequently lowering its inflation rate (devaluation).

No one knows for sure what will happen next time, but it's worth making predictions based on the history of previous years. Especially since it's very transparent and repeats itself time and time again.

Let's take a look at the chart I've prepared for You.🧐


On the chart, I've marked two wedges, which I've colored white. The blue arrows indicate the regularity of three-year cycles. This is the time it takes for these channels to form and the regular way they break out.

After the breakout, the growth percentage is approximately the same ~550%.🚀

Assuming that the breakout occurred last year, from the $40,000 mark (the price has already corrected as it has done every time before - orange circles), and the growth will be like previous times, theoretically, the price in this bull run could reach the $255,000 mark.😱


🧐Do you believe in such growth? Are you concerned about the situation in the world? Share your thoughts in the comments.

💡I also wanted to share my previous chart with you. Perhaps you'll find it interesting.


Thanks for Your attention!
Always sincere with You,

RocketBomb,Bitcoin 2020 vs 2024,2,Initial post,1717404871.0,"Hello, me dear-dear friends! Today, I have prepared a comparison chart of Bitcoin's price formation in 2020 and 2024 for You.


We can see a very interesting pattern on the chart! Specifically, after forming a triangle, the price broke upwards and then halted its ascent, starting to accumulate right at the support level.

That's an excellent signal, in my opinion.🚀

In the near future, we might see either reduced volatility in the market or a sharp upward surge, depending on market sentiment!🤞

Yesterday's chart is also useful, and I highly recommend You check it out :)

RocketBomb,More Than Money 💸,3,Initial post,1712067101.0,"Hello, friends! 😊 What do you associate trading with? 🧐 For most of us it's exchanges and investments are primarily associated with big money. However, trading in the financial markets not only provides opportunities for earning but also for significant skill development and personal growth.


Here are the top 4 qualities that trading helps to develop:

1. Strategic thinking🧠

Systematic approach and having a well-thought-out strategy distinguish a professional trader from a gambler. Seeing that Bitcoin is rising and immediately buying it – that's not how it works: You need to follow rules to earn not situatively, but in the long term. First and foremost, adhere to risk management, which determines 90% of success.

The main rules of risk management in trading that are useful in any endeavor:

In trading: Invest no more than 1-2% of your deposit in one trade.
In life: Don't put everything at stake for short-term gain: soberly assess what you can risk so you won't regret it later.

In trading: It's not so important how much you earn. It's more important how much you lose or don't lose.
In life: Weigh the pros and cons of every serious decision.

In trading: Diversify risks, invest in different instruments so that potential losses from one asset are offset by profits from another.
In life: Always have a plan B, and preferably plan C as well, to achieve your goal. Because if something can go wrong, it will.

In trading: Cut losses to a minimum, let profits grow.
In life: Don't waste energy, time, and resources on what doesn't bring benefits or doesn't work out. Strengthen what's strong: focus on what You do best.


2.Stress tolerance🫨

Trading is not the easiest way to earn a living: you need to be mentally prepared for both profits and losses, not succumb to emotional impulses, and maintain self-control. Sometimes you have to ""rise from the ashes"" and start over from scratch. However, just like in life. Only 2-3% of traders have natural resilience: the rest need to develop it.

Here are some tips from me, which I have formulated from my own experience:

""To develop resilience, allow yourself to make mistakes, take on challenges, and solve complex problems. In doing so, you become stronger.""

""Learn to be flexible, not confined to your internal boundaries. ""

""Don't be afraid to be yourself, to develop internal freedom and individuality, so you can accept your mistakes without criticism. A successful trader is confident, free from societal judgment, and doesn't need to be perfect: they pursue their own goals, not dreams imposed by others.""

3. Independence🕊️

One of the main advantages of trading is freedom: there are no bosses above you, you manage your own time and resources, and you are solely responsible for your actions. You decide how, where, and how much to invest, what risks to take, and so on.

The ability to take responsibility for oneself, not blame others for one's mistakes, and be independent in decision-making is a quality that is valued not only in trading. Independent, self-aware individuals progress faster in their careers, build harmonious relationships, and establish large-scale businesses.

4. Developing 🎓

You can't learn trading once and for all: the market is not static, it's constantly changing. Yesterday, for example, only a few knew about cryptocurrencies, and today fortunes are made on them.

So don't miss the opportunity to learn more, interact with like-minded individuals. Thanks to the Trading View platform for providing such an opportunity. Here You can create your own charts, see what others think, and study educational content.

In conclusion, folks, trading is a unique simulator that develops discipline, forecasting skills, responsibility, independence, psychological resilience, and a drive for self-improvement. All You need is diligence, discipline, and a community of like-minded people! Wishing You success!😘

RocketBomb,"Could Bitcoin be worth $600,000?😱",2,Initial post,1708094260.0,"Hello, friends!🫶 Could Bitcoin be worth $600,000?😱

🧐Today, let's take a look at the weekly logarithmic chart of Bitcoin and try to identify similarities and patterns in its movement to discuss the future price development.


I've highlighted support levels with green 🟢 lines (looking at the overall chart, these levels represented accumulation zones for future growth), and resistance levels with red 🔴 lines (where bullish trends typically ended).

💡 Pay attention! The lower support line was touched twice in 2015-2016, and the next time this happened was in 2023-2024! Looking at the chart, it strongly resembles an accumulation zone!🔋

Could there be a longer cycle?🤩 Let's say, not a 4-year cycle (from halving to halving), but a cycle lasting 10 years? Could Bitcoin be worth $600,000?😱

I'm so interested to hear your opinions and expectations for the upcoming halving and the following year.😏

The world situation is worrisome and doesn't inspire optimism.😔 But if we remember the times of the coronavirus pandemic, then similar sentiments prevailed.🤪

What are your expectations? Let's discuss!😇

Thanks for Your attention!

Sincerely yours, Kateryna💙💛"

As for the current situation, what do we see on the chart?

The price broke out of the triangle upwards and tested it, indicating an organic movement, followed by further growth.

RocketBomb,Ethereum 1d by RB🧐,1,Initial post,1709301600.0,"Hello, dear friends! Today, let's take a look at the Ethereum/Dollar chart!💥


On February 25th, the last line of the descending trend was broken upwards, as indicated by the blue circle - that's serves as an excellent signal for further growth.

The question now is when to expect a correction? And how deep will it be?🧐

The next strong resistance levels are 3590 - 3980! Reaching these levels, the price may start a correction for further growth. The depth of the correction will depend on further price formations, so I will update the chart accordingly!

Thanks for Your attention.
Stay tuned!🫶

It's time to stay vigilant as Bitcoin gains momentum. The inverted head and shoulders pattern remains in play, signaling potential bullish movement ahead.

If Bitcoin manages to break through the crucial 65,650 level, it could serve as a significant signal for the bullish trend, indicating a possible victory over the bearish trend. We can see 70 000 - 71 000 soon!

Don't forget to keep an eye on this fractal for potential insights into market behavior. 👇

RocketBomb,BTC on 9 h vs 1h charts💥,1,Initial post,1716195404.0,"Hello, friends! 🩷 Bitcoin is once again hovering and teasing us with its movement. 😏You might think it's stuck just like it was a few months ago, when we anticipated a price drop, but in my view, there are some differences that I'll try to describe in this post.👇



For clarity, I divided our chart into two parts - the left side showing the 9-hour timeframe, and the right side showing the hourly timeframe.

👐On the longer timeframe - the left side - we see that the price has broken out of the triangle upwards. Many of You, seeing a fake breakout from the same triangle before, might rightfully ask,<< could this be another fakeout?>> In my opinion - no, because the price has already consolidated sufficiently above. So, we have a breakout of the triangle.

👐Now, let's move to the chart on the left - the hourly one! There we see our breakout with the price formed in more detail! We can observe impulsive movements and the formation of a short-term channel, looking at which we can expect the price to rise to the 67,500 level. Then, we may either continue forming this channel by lowering the price to 66,100 and then rising again to 67+.

I think this will be the accumulation period before the moon flight:))
