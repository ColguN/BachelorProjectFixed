Ethereum is doing worse but this means that the correction is more advanced on this pair; below you can find Ethereum's monthly chart and analysis:

‚ûñ While Ethereum is 33% down, Bitcoin is only 17% down.
‚ûñ While for Bitcoin April closed within March's wick low, for Ethereum the close was much lower compared to its previous month producing a penetration of support. April's monthly close for Ethereum fully confirms the next bearish move (down).

‚ûñ Ethereum and Bitcoin move together.
‚ûñ Ethereum, Bitcoin and the entire global financial markets are connected and what happens in one place affects everything.

Conclusion

üëâ Ethereum is likely to hit bottom before Bitcoin.

This is important for those who are going to try and catch the bottom in anticipation of the next Cryptocurrency market bull-run.

The market is great.

Even though we get confirmation after confirmation, doubts still creeps in.
Even though we see the market moving just as we would expect it to move based on the cycle, sentiment and chart signals; confirmation after confirmation, for real.

Somehow, each time there is a small rise in price doubt creeps in.

""Bitcoin is trading above $60,000 after all and that's pretty strong.""

Well, actually, below 70K is ultra-bearish after a new ATH at 74K, but this is not the topic for this update.

In early 2022 we were discussing here on TradingView the bear-market that was developing for Crypto and how far down Bitcoin would go.

We were dead set on finding the target and as you know, we shared hundreds and hundreds of charts. All of us, the different players.

After a while, we decided that Bitcoin was going to settle around 20K because that was the 2017 ATH. We concluded that the bottom would happen in June or November 2021 and reach several others and varied conclusions.

We all agreed and everything was clear; it was early 2022, we still had a long way to go before reaching 20K; Bitcoin crashed below 20K and yes, even 15K was tested as support.

A certain public figure, I won't name any names, said in early 2022 that Bitcoin would move lower but stay above 30K. It doesn't matter what happens it would never go below 30K... Bitcoin was trading in the 40Ks at the time.

Sure enough, that was the signal...
Bitcoin crashed and did not move below 30K but went even lower and hit below 16K.

The same character is now saying that ""Bitcoin will stay in $55K to $75K zone for now"" ... This means that the crash is confirmed and it is going below 30K.

üÖ±Ô∏è Time To Trade

Right now we are witnessing a ""bounce.""

Each time an important level is hit, either up (resistance) or down (support), the market reacts with a move to the opposite side, in this case a ""price jump"" or ""bounce.""

‚ûñ How we do know if this is just a bounce instead of the start of a new bullish wave?

The trading volume gives it away... There is no volume.

And of course, the market movers (whales/exchanges) will definitely liquidate the SHORTs before producing a new low.

You see, Crypto is deposited into the exchange.
You use this Crypto to buy stuff.

When this Crypto sits around on the exchange wallet, they take this money and loan it out and you get something... Sometimes, if you are in the earn program if not, they make money on your money and that's ok but the problem is that now the market turns.

‚ûñ If you are trading spot, the value of your Cryptos can rise or fall ‚Äînothing happens; just wait.
‚ûñ If you are using margin or leverage, your entire account can be gone.

That's why there is a move up before going lower, because the whales want money... And many people use too much leverage; now, that's their fault.

We are not going to single out whales and exchanges, everybody is working to make money, that's the final goal.

The reason why these people get liquidated is not because billionaires are evil, but because their leverage is too high, we are talking about 15X, 20X, 25X etc. In truth, 1-2X first and then we use a little more. Anything higher without years of planning can be called gambling, but i don't know. I am not a gambler so I can't really say, I only read the charts.

I've been around ""leveraged trading"" and if you are not a professional, it is very likely that you are fooling yourself and wasting money as you go.

If that's not the case... üëâ Then BTCUSDT is an easy hold.

What will it be?
Down or up?

The chart continues 100% clear.
We have another lower high...

It doesn't matter if you miss the game today but...

What about tomorrow?
What about next week, next month?
What about years into the future?

How long have you been trading for?

Are you successful?
Are you profitable?

How long have you been working for?

Are you rich?
Are you satisfied?
Are you happy?

You see... Whatever you put in, in time, is what you receive.

Whatever the world gives to you is based on your actions, your behavior, your mentality, your thoughts.

How much money one makes will depend on the state of mind, the experience; how honest you are with yourself?

This market can be tough... If you are an egotist, you are going to get out of here broke.

On the other hand, if you can accept and appreciate your mistakes; taking responsibility for your actions rather than blaming others; the market definitely pays with success.

First we focus on personal growth and this growth will lead to a stable mind and with this stable mind we can trade.

üçÄ AFFIRMATIONS TO ATTRACT ABUNDANCE

Whenever a feeling of lack or need comes to your beautiful mind, immediately replace it for one or more of the following affirmations; they are meant to attract wealth and abundance to your life ‚Äînow!

""Everyday in every way, my wealth is increasing.""

You can choose one or more and repeat them often ‚Äîthree times before sleep and right after waking up!

""I deserve prosperity and I accept prosperity in my life now!""

""I have a wonderful work, in a wonderful way, I give wonderful service, for a wonderful pay!""

Some people repeat them 10,000 times per day!
It works; try it!

Re-read this post, over and over, again and again ...

""I am so happy and grateful now, that money comes to me, in increasing quantities, from multiple sources, on a continuous basis.""

""By day and by night I am being prospered in all of my interests.""

There is no virtue in poverty; it is a disease like any other mental disease.

Change your mental attitude toward money with the following affirmation:

""I like money, I love it, I use it wisely, constructively and judiciously. Money is constantly in my life, I release it with joy and it returns to me multiplied in a wonderful way. It is good, very good. Money flows to me in avalanches of abundance. I use it for good only and I am grateful for my good and for the riches of my mind.""

I love you!

üÖ±Ô∏è Impossible To Predict: Mixed Signals

What we've been seeing lately is a quite complex situation and one of the hardest, if not the hardest of all, to predict based on Technical Analysis. Bitcoin is mixed!

Mixed because we have a mixture of bullish and bearish signals.
‚ûñ Bullish technicals, with bearish potential.
‚ûñ Bullish conditions with bearish developments.

With a more than two months long consolidation pattern, Bitcoin can go either way.
A consolidation pattern can be either bullish or bearish, but it is a very well known fact that a consolidation pattern can only be confirmed after the breakout.

Say a pattern has a 60/40 chance, or even 80/20 between bullish and bearish and yet the bearish side, even with the lower potential can develop. In reverse, a bullish breakout can happen anytime.

The market is mixed 50/50 based on this and other signals, I can expand, and this is the very annoying situation for traders and holders alike. What will you do knowing this?

There are tens of thousands of Altcoins trading pairs and these will start fluctuating even more when the next breakout comes.

The majority of the Altcoins are set to produce a major crash, another crash which will lead to the final support being established, the correction bottom low.

Now, some people are in a bit of hurry to see prices moving down or up but that's not how the market works. The market tend to take its time and only when most people break will the market move.

Right now things are not clear but Bitcoin can go up, up, up... Bitcoin can go up.

The next major move is a very, very strong drop... It can happen within 6 days just as it can take 3-4 weeks but not much more. (Mid June 2024 for the bottom.)

You can wait for the breakout and profit all the way to $100K.
Smart readers will either stay out or wait patiently, because it is much more wiser to wait for the crash rather than buying to see everything drop the next day.

It doesn't matter what the market do next and that we cannot predict... But we can prepare because we know that action is always going on. Instead of looking for the next big one, the 10,000%+, instead we focus on daily wins, a winning strategy and this winning strategy can produce positive long-term results.

I remember back in those days when I used to focus on the short-term.
I would go to the 5minutes chart, 15minutes can ""confirm"" whatever I was seeing, over and over, and yet somehow the market always moved the other way.

My efforts were a pure waste, of energy, because the bigger picture didn't change no matter how much my anxieties and stress built up.

So, instead of trying to guess the next move of the market why not prepare for both scenarios knowing that what goes down, must move back up.

‚ûñ Bitcoin has been rising since day 1.
‚ûñ Bitcoin has been moving up since it was created, since its first trading day.
‚ûñ Bitcoin will continue growing, there is no doubt, so why would anybody worry about a correction that will only last a few days?

It is impossible to predict the future but Bitcoin is soon going down, would you like to bet?

A friendly piece of advice based on more than 10 years of trading experience...

Hello dear Cryptocurrency lover, I am back sharing some of my experience with you today. I am hoping that you find this information useful for your learning journey.

Problems arise due to the expectations we hold.

Say what you will, but if you are buying/holding Cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin, you are likely doing so with the expectation of making money (speculation).

Having the wrong expectations can wreak havoc to your mental and financial well-being if things do not develop according to what we predict. So the first thing we do is to remove all expectations.

Say you are buying an Altcoin trading pair with the goal of earning 150% from a bullish move; an up-move.

You decide to buy this pair now and sure enough, the market starts to grow.
Say the market grows for 1 week, 2 weeks straight up... It tends to fluctuate as seen on the chart but for the sake of simplicity let's say the market moves up 80% and then stops.

The market can grow 2-3 weeks straight for a total of 100% and then reverse fully.
While the initial move went up, it did not reach our 150% target so we end up holding and the ensuing correction can lead to a flash crash and then a waiting of four months before prices move back up to the initial entry level.

One can buy and see 20% up, 30% up fast and then things start to reverse... What was once an easy and fast win, can turn into a long-term hold or into a loss because we can have a 50% target but the market only grew by 40%... Let's clarify this example now using Bitcoin.

Imagine you buy Bitcoin at $65,000 with a LONG bias.
Say Bitcoin grows and hits $73,000; are you going to sell?

Say Bitcoin grows even higher and hits $84,000, 20% higher compared $70,000; are you going to sell?

Because Bitcoin can go up 20% but then reverse and move to $60,000.
Now, $60,000 is below the $65,000 entry level in this example; what would you do now? Hold or take the loss?

What if Bitcoin moves then to $50,000?

Remember, it did move up to $80,000, $90,000, etc. in this example before moving lower, but we didn't sell in expectations of higher prices!

What if $50,000 breaks as support and Bitcoin moves to $40K? Sell now or hold?

Will Bitcoin move from $40,000 to $100,000?
Or will Bitcoin move from $40,000 to $20,000?

It is impossible to know.

This is what we know with 100% certainty!

You were not around in early 2023.

Where were you in early 2023 when Bitcoin was trading below $20,000?
Why not buy at this amazing price when the chart was ultra-bullish?

You see, Bitcoin and the Cryptocurrency market never moves straight up!

Do this, go open the chart as BTCUSDT.
Choose the weekly timeframe and look at January 2018. What do you see?

After a massive period of growth, we get a massive period of prices moving down.

Don't believe?
Let's try again.

Look at November 2021? What do you see?

After a very strong period of growth, we get a massive correction lasting years not month.

Look now at early 2024!
Bitcoin grew from November 2022 through March 2024.
After massive growth a very strong correction tends to follow.

Did you ever saw a bullish article on television, the news, the media; telling you to buy Bitcoin at $16K?

Have you ever seen a news article telling you to sell Bitcoin in 2021 when it was at the top at 69K? No!

All these articles tend to reflect what is happening in the moment and what is happening in the moment is already priced in, the market is looking for the next move when most people become active.

The reason why the majority is always wrong is because they only hear about these things such as Bitcoin, this market, after it is already high up.

The best time to buy is when prices are down, not at the top.

Say you are a long-term holder and you want to buy Bitcoin for the long-term, so you don't care; Still, it is better to buy at $40,000, $30,000 or $25,000 rather than buying at $60,000 or $70,000... Makes sense?

How far up can it go?

Do this exercise... Visualize Bitcoin going up, up, up... How far up can it go?
$150,000? $200,000? $400,000?

Will you sell?
If yes, when and by how much?
Would you sell everything or just a portion?

Do you see how complex it is?

It becomes extremely easy when you buy at the bottom and sell as prices increase.

Patience is key!

Thanks a lot for your continued support.

Note: Just wait, the market is not going anywhere... I sold everything long ago.
We will see in 2-3 weeks time if the bottom of the correction is already in or if we will get a new market bottom low... I am betting on a new low, what about you?

Being honest and straight forward, can you imagine the amount of pain that can be caused if this is it?

Here is the weekly timeframe:

What do I mean with ""this is it?""

TradingView's Bitcoin index chart is the best because of the volume. It uses a combination of volume from multiple exchanges giving us a better picture as to what is really happening with the market action.

Is this it?

We've been tracking this amazing asset, Bitcoin, and we've been expecting a correction.
The peak/ATH remains at March 2024.

The longer it takes for prices to drop, the strongest the potential for the ensuing move.
üëâ Since Bitcoin's bearish potential remains intact while Bitcoin has been above 60K for 3 months; the ensuing correction can turn into a crash rather a ""normal correction.""

Notice the wording on the latest Ethereum news release, it says, ""People are buying the rumor...""
The rumor for the SPOT ETF... Reminds me of something, ""Buy the rumor, sell the news!""

The current situation is interesting to say the least, for both bulls and bears.

The last two weekly session has no volume.
Both candles volume is very low.

We use volume to identify a move; real or fake?
By fake we mean a ""short-squeeze."" This means that prices are moving up as a whales-market move in order to liquidate leveraged traders. Once the SHORT traders liquidation is over and done, Bitcoin will resume with its move down and produce a new lower low.

A lower low compared to $56,500... üëâ Which means that Bitcoin will soon trade below 50K.

Remember, we have all the days left in May and also June for the main low to be in... It can be wild, don't get trapped in this mixed situation, read the previous updates and make sure to do your research, take your time to plan and study because the market is not going away.

Since Bitcoin is here to stay; Since we are buying and trading Bitcoin long-term; It is better to wait for the best prices before making any moves... When in doubt, sit it out.

You can thank me later...

Think about it, do you really belief it will move straight up?
If yes, what's the next final target?

Is it $76,000, $84,000, $90,000 or more?

If you say more and Bitcoin does move up and hits $100K, will you sell or hold?

That's my question for you... Try to answer in the comments below but also consider, what would you do if there is no new highs and Bitcoin crashes toward the low 20Ks?

These last questions are not a prediction; we prepare for all scenarios, bearish and bullish. So I am trying to share our experience with you... It is not just me, there are thousands and thousands of us that have been here for many years and want you to avoid the discomfort that we had to go through when we were in the same situation but years ago.

Anything can happen but the chart doesn't look great for LONG.
The chart looks good for selling, SHORT or HOLD.

I am waiting, literally... We will see based on the results.

The Altcoins will be mixed as they continue to be mixed now, just as predicted and it will get worse.
We will have pairs going up, others going down while others go sideways... This is good for trading not bad, because we know there are always opportunities for growth.

We are seeing some pairs 50% down, while others are 80% up.
We are seeing new highs being hit, as well as new market bottom lows.

üëâ We buy the low ones and sell those high up.

Sounds good to me, how does that sound to you?

The universe will bless those that dedicate time and energy to learning, preparation and personal growth. This is the recipe needed for success in the 2025 Cryptocurrency bull-market but this bull-market that ends in 2025 will start in 2024.

Just one more final drop; After this drop several major shakeouts (be aware of 2-3 additional swings after the low is in), and after the shakeouts UP WE GO!

The most important of all the signals, details and action to consider is...

Love & support.
I'll give you the content and you send me love.

AlanSantana,üÖ±Ô∏è Final Warning: A 50% Capitulation Drop Will Lead To 30K,BTC,30,Initial post,1714194719,62896.38,"This is the final warning and a friendly reminder; what we are about to witness is a ""capitulation drop!""

This event is not your common drop or ""normal correction,"" instead, it is a major event that only happens once every several years and you have front row sits for it.

‚ûñ If we calculate the average price for Bitcoin's trading range in the past month and a half, we get a number around $66,600.

‚ûñ If we divide this number by two, the 50% capitulation drop, we get a number in the range of $33,300.

üëâ Here is my idea of how Bitcoin will behave around this number if a capitulation drop does show up in the coming days or next month; May 2024 ... But first, let me tell you that May is normally a bad month for Cryptocurrency when the action is coming out of a multiple-years price high ‚Äîthat is BTCUSDT. This is the situation in which we are at today.

Bitcoin is trading at the highest prices ever and has been on distribution for quite a while now, this phase is about to reach soon two months.

This phase can last, it can last 3 months, 4 months and sometimes even a total of 6 months before the capitulation actually happens but do not worry, it won't extend this much this time around because the halving just took place.

Boost this trade idea and we will comeback for frequent updates.

So it is likely that this is it, the capitulation happens now, this or next month, and this is what we've been waiting for to start the new phase, the new wave, the new entry, the bull-market that will really heat up late, very late 2024 and all throughout 2025. All throughout 2025 it will be super, it will be big, it will be great; it will be the opportunity we have been waiting for.

What are you doing now?

Is not really about Bitcoin going to $100,000 before a correction or whatnot or predicting what happens next; It is really about buying when prices are low, waiting patiently and selling high at the top of the bullish wave.

‚ûñ The time to buy was last year or after the flush takes place.
‚ûñ The time to sell will be next year, after the bull-run is on its way.

Whatever the market does in the mid to short-term, there are always clear signals before a reversal takes place.

Look at the chart; volume continues to drop, the RSI becomes weaker every day. The loss of bullish momentum is the major indicator we have predicting a bearish wave.

The action should go something like this: The initial drop fast and strong; remember that the initial move is bearish marketwide, period. Then this move stabilizes and the ALTSBTC and smaller Altcoins will recover first. Mid-size second and the biggest one last.

Bitcoin is likely to recover 30-50% from the flash crash bottom low and then start a slow climb. Something like hitting ~30K in a flash and then moving to around ~45K to produce very strong volatility but to never look back, straight up but very slow growth for months and months... Imagine 6-8 months within a bullish consolidation phase. Rising but slowly until in Q1/Q2 2025 when everything really starts to speed up.

üëâ So only one bottom and that's it... We will have to rush if we want to buy BTC.

The rest we will have plenty of time, it will be wild, it will be fast, it will be crazy, exciting... For many it will be profitable for others it will be bad as loses can add up for the unprepared and can even multiply.

Prepare now or plan, if not by doing numbers at least try and visualize... What would you do if you knew Bitcoin would hit ~30K before hitting a new All-Time High?

Looking at the other side and maintaining and open perspective, Bitcoin continues bullish on the weekly timeframe.

One of the main indicators we look at for a potential change of trend, is based on the moving average of ten periods (EMA10). Bitcoin briefly moved below this level last week but ended up closing above it; see the chart:

‚ûñ Weekly EMA10 now stands at $63,000.
üëâ Bullish above; bearish below.

On top of this little fact we also have a bull flag as a major pattern on the chart.

üÖ±Ô∏è Bitcoin Is Here To Stay!

While some people right now are calling for a major bear-market, the end of the bullish cycle and a crash toward $11,300; some are even making mention of $3,000 and even $1,000 ... No comment.

Wait! ...
Yes comment!

It is an actual impossibility for Bitcoin to hit below $15,000; don't you agree?

In fact, it is impossible for Bitcoin to even move below $20,000... In the worst case scenario we are looking at a price range of $21,000 - $24,000 as the worst case bottom scenario for a flash crash or black swan event.

Bitcoin is here to stay!

Bitcoin is the greatest invention since the Internet, for now, but it might actually turn out to be the best invention since money, actual cash.

In the age of information, technology; Bitcoin will be as important as your method of transport or even as your sacred and divine smart phone, that's how good Bitcoin is.

‚ûñ We all agree that a bull-market takes place after the halving ‚Äîyes?

‚ûñ We all agree that a new All-Time High is always hit a year after the halving, don't we?

‚ûñ And we might all agree that a correction, at least one, is always present before the long-term bullish cycle develops that ends in a bull-run, just as it happened back in 2021 and 2017...

Bitcoin is here to stay!!!

It doesn't matter what anybody say;
It doesn't matter how prices trade or move short-term;
It doesn't matter if the crash leads to 30 or 40K...
Bitcoin is here to stay!

Let's say it drops a little bit; yes, big deal... Those who really love and understand Bitcoin can simply hold/wait!

‚ûñ Bitcoin is now trading weekly below EMA10.
We are officially in bearish territory after four weeks of BTCUSDT closing red and a total of seven weeks of sideways action.


‚ûñ Sideways price action can be considered neutral or bullish but the fact that the action is moving below EMA10 makes this a bearish development.

‚ûñ If we look back to October 2023 on the weekly timeframe, BTCUSDT never trades below EMA10 weekly. As the bullish force is active, the action always remain above this indicator's line (green on this chart). Moving below signals that the bulls are losing momentum.

The week is early; the week is new though.

This is indeed a bearish development and Bitcoin is set to move lower but, this is just the start of the week. The action can as easily move back up above EMA10, the weekly session turn green and the entire seven weeks of sideways action become a very healthy consolidation phase. It would support perfectly a rise beyond 84,000 to maybe 90,000 or even 100K. That's the hopelessly greedy scenario that some are contemplating and let's hope it becomes true.

It can be a strong drop, a month or two, but we grow long-term.

üÖ±Ô∏è Bitcoin Weekly | Quick Chart Update

One of the patterns that kept many people waiting for bearish confirmation, understandably, is the bull-flag. Here we have a bull-flag on the weekly timeframe, obviously a very strong pattern.


This pattern tends to be considered bullish and indeed it is, but patterns and signals cannot be considered in isolation. All signals and data points coming from the charts must be considered in combination with other signals for them to be of value to us.

While a bull-flag is considered a bullish continuation pattern, to us this is not the case when the market is trading at multi-year highs. Weakness is revealed after 8 weeks of sideways and 4 weeks consecutive closing red with lower highs; that's the context.

Right now we have a breakdown of the bullish flag and this is noted by the current candle moving below the lower trendline. The break below EMA10 is also there. Confirmation only happens once the week closes.

The fact that this is happening mid-week, at this point, is also a bearish signal.

Bearish, bearish, bearish, bearish... How far down will it really go?

üëâ We are open to all scenarios... Bitcoin already lost $60,000 and $58,000 as support. Minimum we go to 50/52K next... But after this level, how far down will it go?

Notice on the weekly chart, there isn't one red brick from November 2022 through March 2024 (the uptrend).

One very important point to keep in mind is the duration of the correction.

When we use the general term ""short-term"" we are referring here to a period of 1-3 months. Everybody uses these terms differently but for us it means within 30-90 days.

This correction is a ""short-term"" move.
It should last only within 1-3 months.

Here the tricky and interesting points to note:

1) Bitcoin peaked 14-March 2024. While some people are realizing only now that Bitcoin is dropping, it has been in its bearish wave for 1.5 months (technically speaking).

2) The low can hit after 2 months or 3 months, etc. So the entire correction can last, say, 2.5 months (75 days). After the low is in, it can take 1-3 months for prices to move back up to current levels or even more... That's the interesting part.

While the correction ""just started"" for many, it has been going for almost two months.

While the entire correction phase should end fast, for many, it can last between 4-6 months, the entire period.

It can take 4-8 months from March 2024 until Bitcoin is back up to the same levels and challenging resistance in order to hit new All-Time Highs (2025).

All this information leads me to realize just one thing: The market offers endless opportunities and patience is key to win!

While many of the big Altcoins already completed their full correction, with a strong Bitcoin drop this would still push prices lower on all those pairs. The initial reaction can be strong all across but it can settle very quickly.

Many pairs already hit bottom and can grow even if Bitcoin drops, thinks ALTSBTC. Some of the ALTSUSDT can also move forward but only after the initial reaction and those that didn't produce a major bullish wave early 2024/late 2023.

üìà How To Know Which Altcoins Will Grow And Which Ones Will Move Lower | How Far Down Can A Pair Really Go? Altcoins Market Map Revealed!

Ok. There are tens of thousands of Altcoins trading pairs and this is the reason why it is obvious to consider each pair individually. There is no point in making generalisations because there are just too many of us.

Some people can have a 1-3% stop-loss while others can have a 20-30% stop-loss. A correction can affect very different an investor, a long-term trader, a day-trader, scalper, futures trader and so on.

Some will go down while others go up but there is a way to identify exactly at which point in the cycle each pair is currently at.

As always, I am an open book ... and I am sharing my experience, wisdom and knowledge with you. I am sending you LOVE! ... Know, that I love YOU!

Ok, let's get started!

‚ûñ How do I know if the trading pair that I am interested in is likely to move lower or higher based on the current market situation?

‚ûñ How do I know how far down a pair can go in this correction?

Let's start by saying that we can't know for sure and thus we are only going to be making some approximations. We look at the pairs that are more advanced within the current market cycle and whatever they are doing the rest will do the same. This is the method we used to find the main resistance levels on the way up for the previous bullish wave and the method I used to find the main support levels for the current bearish wave. It is the same method I will use to predict the next set of targets when the next bullish wave comes in a matter of months.

The majority of the Altcoins (we are talking about USDT pairs here), hit a low around September/October 2023. All these Altcoins went ahead to produce a very strong bullish wave. This wave peaked late 2023 for many, many Altcoins ‚Äîsome of the smaller ones that many of you are not looking at, while others continued through 2024 and present day.

Now, some pairs grew between 2-3X while others grew 10-15X.
The correction potential for those that grew between 10-15X is much stronger compared to those that grew only 2-3X. Cardano is a great example; while some other projects (like Solana) have to move much lower, Cardano doesn't have much lower to go or the bottom might be already in. Might be, there can be another drop but just to give you an example.

Another example is XRPUSDT.
This pair potentially bottomed while some others still have to go through the whole corrective phase. Now, and this is the hard part, many pairs are in-between their correction and these are the ones that I want to expose to you.

Say the bullish wave is over, Solana (SOLUSDT).

üëâ The correction is likely to end around the 0.618 - 0.786 Fib. retracement range for the entire bullish wave.

We can be talking about a bullish wave that lasted 300 days or 30 days, makes no difference at this point.

We plot the ""Fib Retracement"" tool with the value '0' being the last high, this is the price that hit early 2024 or late 2023 for most pairs. The next value, '1', should be plotted at the last major low before the bullish wave; the bearish cycle bottom. Doing this will give you the Fibonacci retracement numbers for the entire bullish wave.

If you find a pair, using the weekly timeframe, where a wick or candle pierced through these levels, you can feel sure that the correction low is likely in. If it isn't in, then one more low and that's it.

This low won't necessarily lead to a straight up arrow as the next bullish jump. If it does, it would be a wave five of a bullish impulse leading to a major correction then higher low before the bull-market takes place.

Now, the general scenario that is likely to develop on most chart goes as follows: A drop in the above mentioned range, then an accumulation/consolidation phase forming kind of a cup pattern, can last 2-4 months and then the action starts going all the way through 2025 and new All-Time Highs.

The correction cannot be avoided.
We have a long-term triple top.

üÖ±Ô∏è Bitcoin | Bullish Signals

Today is Sunday and the week is about to close. There is only 8 hours left on the weekly candle/session... We have some bullish signals to look at.

While we have a bearish bias, we continue to keep an open perspective and always follow the chart.
While we believe Bitcoin is moving lower, this is only because the chart says so. If the chart changes, we also change!

Here we have Bitcoin on the weekly timeframe:

‚ÄîTrading above EMA10 = bullish.

Bitcoin moved back above EMA10 and has a long lower wick/shadow on the current session. This lower wick means that the bears sold, try to push prices lower but failed. The failure to push prices lower turns this into a bullish signal.

‚ÄîVolume

Volume is good and rising. This is a bullish signal. Bitcoin closing above EMA10 weekly ($63,150), is positive for the bulls short-term.

‚ÄîSupport holds

This weekly session only wicked below the 4-March low. Closing above this level is a signal of strength.
(It would be extremely bearish if the market turns red and the week ends up closing below.)

‚ÄîGreen weekly close

If the week closes green, this is positive.
A negative close would be ultra-bearish but so far it is looking good.

There is still room for prices to fluctuate, as in the 65-74,000 price range but, these signals point to higher prices in the coming days... Do you agree?

Bitcoin is now definitely bullish on the 4H timeframe;
By Bitcoin being bullish on this timeframe it means that prices are now moving higher; set to move higher, climbing up.

We can clearly see here how Bitcoin is trading above all moving averages with a bullish continuation pattern and bullish MACD.

üëâ While this is all great, it allows more time for the Altcoins to grow, remember that this is a short-term move and massive resistance awaits below 70K.

üÖ±Ô∏è Bitcoin For Beginners | Short-Term vs Long-Term

Sorry for creating confusion my dear readers, I shall explain.

The charts we read are based on different ""timeframes."" Each timeframe denotes a certain time horizon. The longer the timeframe, the more data becomes available for analysis on the chart.

The shorter the term, less data becomes available.

If we are looking at the 1H or 4H timeframes, these are considered short-term and whatever information is captured from these charts should only be considered in the short-term. Since each candle/session has only 1/4 hours, then the chart changes every 1/4 hours. But, if we look at the weekly timeframe, this we call long-term as it takes an entire week before the chart can change.

So, bullish short-term, bullish mid-term and bullish long-term.

There is bearish potential short-term for a major correction to develop which is already in the chart.
Bitcoin closed red for more than 4 weeks and has been ranging with swings being 20% each. A 20% move counter-trend can be defined as either a retrace or correction.

The thesis here is that before the next higher high, there can be a new lower low compared to the most recent low, that is, Bitcoin can move to the low 50Ks or lower... But things can change.

Whenever Bitcoin is trading now above $70,000 to $72,000, this is considered bullish.
‚ûñ If Bitcoin moves above $74,000, this is ultra-bullish.
‚ûñ If Bitcoin trades below $70,000, this is bearish confirmed short-term because Bitcoin is moving within a lower high after the March 2024 All-Time High.

üÖ±Ô∏è An ABC Correction Can't Be Over!

An ABC correction has four main points: The start of wave A (zero), wave A, wave B and wave C.

Regardless of the type of correction; flat or irregular, we only get four main points for the move to be completed.

‚ûñ The end of wave A can be a higher low compared to the end of wave C.
‚ûñ The end of wave B can be either a higher high compared to the ATH or a lower higher. This determines if the correction is either regular or irregular, but it doesn't change the fact that two main reactions are needed on the lower side of the equation for a correction to be complete.

Complex?
Hard to understand?
What do you mean?

Let's look at the chart:

Trading volume continues to drop.
Notice how one final drop is still needed for a classic ABC correction to be completed. We need two reactions on the lower end of the wave pattern (A & C). We are missing wave C.

üëâ Everything is set to crash including the Altcoins.

You've been warned!

This is a friendly reminder and intended only for your convenience.

Bitcoin will soon be 2 full months in the red. This will only lead the market to produce the final correction low and once the low is in we can start buying to enjoy the bullish rally; sustained long-term growth (2025 & late 2024).

It seems this week and next week will be very important, the distribution period is leading to such.

I am still in doubt if the distribution phase will end now, this/next week, or if it will last another two months (4 months total for the bottom low to be set)... Very hard to say, don't you agree?

Looking at the trading volume on this chart, we can see it stalled completed; this can be interpreted as the market reaching an equilibrium.

A drop in volume is also indicative of a decline in momentum.

üÖ±Ô∏è Bitcoin Weekly Update

Remember the weekly timeframe?
Bitcoin is now trading below EMA10!

Last time we were tracking this indicator, Bitcoin moved to hit a new lower low but recovered and closed above EMA10 by the end of the week. We have a bias at this point, a bearish bias but, if the chart changes we must adapt and change because our method is based on the chart.

As Bitcoin trades above EMA10 weekly, we remain bearish but cautious because this is a bullish development. And so, we would say to simplify things for our followers, readers and supporters: ""If Bitcoin trades above 72/74K = bullish. If Bitcoin trades below 70K = bearish/SHORT.""

‚ûñ It is the first time that Bitcoin will move below EMA10 weekly in more than 8 months.

‚ûñ It is the first time that Bitcoin will move below EMA10 weekly after a multi-year high in more than 2.5 years; a long time.

I am sharing this to say that this is a major bearish development and a full confirmation of the major crash that is about to take place.

As soon as EMA10 is lost as support, the next level opens up.

The next support target is EMA21 but we will skip it and go to EMA50 which sits at $46,000. So there will be a stop at the low 50Ks but this level is also likely to fast break.

The final level here is MA200 sitting at $34,000.

We can use Fib. retracements, price action, moving averages or any method we want, everything is pointing toward the same range in which we had a long accumulation phase in 2023, the one that lasted many months. This is the level/range that needs to be tested as support before Bitcoin can grow beyond $100,000+.

The fact that it was so hard for Bitcoin to break below 64-62K, means that this level will be a strong resistance on the way up. It will take some time to comeback but we will comeback and go even higher... Bitcoin is likely to trade above 70,000 in early 2025 and above 150,000 by May 2025.

üÖ±Ô∏è We Are Not Out Of The Danger Zone Yet!

When comparing today's situation with 2016, in relation to Bitcoin's halving event and the ensuing correction; let me tell you that we are not out of the ""danger-zone"" just yet, it is too early.

The danger zone, based on past history/data, lasts between 9-12 weeks after the halving, we are only four weeks into the current halving.

While in the past, 2016, a correction followed just a few weeks after the event, this doesn't mean that it needs to happen now in exactly the same way.

The projected recovery year in 2023 based on a comparison of the action we had in 2019, signaled the end of a bullish wave in Q3 2023 with prices between 50-60K, the end result was a bullish wave but the duration was quite different compared to past price action, it lasted so much more and prices went much higher than projected.

So just because the correction didn't happen right away, it doesn't mean that we are in the green just yet.

Just keep in mind the basics, Bitcoin is trading weekly below EMA10.

‚ûñ Bearish volume rose to hit its highest level in March 2024 since June 2022. Indicating that the bears are now in the game.

üëâ Bitcoin is now officially trading within bearish territory.

This signal can be interpreted as the start of a short-term bearish wave. If the wave will be long or short in duration we cannot tell at this point; assuming our halving theory, bull-market, etc., we expect a short-term correction ‚Äîfast and strong followed by sustained growth but this is just speculation of course.

‚ûñ The truth is that Bitcoin moved completely different in this cycle compared to previous cycle.

‚ûñ The truth is that we are in uncharted territory, whoever gets it has done a good job at this point.

üëâ The correction can be mild or strong.

So far all signals continue to point toward a major crash in the coming days or weeks; it can always extend but the bearish signals are only becoming stronger, the bullish side weaker.

The feeling right now is as if there are no buyers... Waiting... Waiting for something; maybe the movement of some funds. Maybe the waiting is for some market participants to become complacent or maybe simply this is just how human psychology works.

There was plenty of time to sell at the top but for many this isn't enough... Right now we are going down and instead of securing amazing profits, some people are kind of greedy hoping for more.

All we can say is that Bitcoin will grow in the long-term... But short-term, prepare for the drop!

The noise are moves within phases of the market cycle; for example, the trend is up but you get ""noise,"" prices moving up/down based on the buy/sell orders of varied market participants.

AlanSantana,üÖ±Ô∏è Bitcoin 2-4 Months... We Are Two Months In... Liquidity,BTC,2,Initial post,1715875928,65712.33,"If the entire bearish wave takes a total of 4 months, we have only two months left before the whole move is completed. But the wave doesn't necessarily lasts 4 months, it can last 3 months or 6 months but not two. Can't be two because 14-March was the top and we are beyond 2 months already into the bearish wave.

Now, this is what I've been sharing with you for a while...
This is my understanding of the signals coming from the charts and market dynamics.

While this is technical analysis and truly focused mainly on the chart; fundamentals, sentiment, feelings, emotions, the stars (Astrology), related markets, geo-politics and the rest, are all considered for the final conclusion.

If Bitcoin produces a new bottom low now, it would still take months to recover.

Prices ""recovering"" and moving back up after a long-term higher low is extremely bullish.

Just as it can take 2 months to move from $74,000 to $60,000;
It can take 2-3 months to move from $30,000 to $60,000 (down from up) or more.

This is to say that it can take a while before Bitcoin moves to new highs if a major correction shows up.

This is still an ""if"" because even though I have a high level of confidence in my analysis, I can be completely wrong.

‚ûñ The fact that Bitcoin has been bearish for two months but still trades above 60K, can be considered a bullish signal. Other bullish factors such as the recent growth wave works against the bulls.

The market tends to fluctuate between down and up and thus strong bullish action has bearish potential at the top, while strong bearish action has bullish potential after a new low.

If Bitcoin turns bullish, we also turn bullish; that's for sure.

üëâ Bitcoin for us goes bullish above $74,000 on a daily basis, with confirmation needed on a weekly basis.

üëâ Any trading below 70,000 is ultra-bearish.

‚ûñ The longer Bitcoin trades below this level without challenging it, the weaker it becomes.
‚ûñ The longer Bitcoin fails to challenge the last high (ATH), the stronger the bearish bias and potential.

It is likely that Bitcoin will not grow next... Remember the expert, he said Bitcoin would range between 55-75K. This is not possible because the All-Time High is 74K.

You cannot range above the range and thus we know what comes next.

Ask yourself:

‚ûñ Where do these people get this information?
‚ûñ Is there anything to back such claim?

The fundamentals are great, yes; we all love Bitcoin but, the fundamentals is what pushed Bitcoin up to 74K. Now that the fundamentals wave is exhausted, the market moves the other way.

New players are desperate to join, I get messages everyday.
People want to buy Bitcoin but it is too expensive and the market wants them to play.

Remember the word ""liquidity"" ... Where is the liquid?

Where is the money?

Wherever the money is, that's where the energy will go.

Liquidity is down now and so... Down we go!

XRP is dropping again but you can not change the market cycles. In the following charts I will give you my thoughts on xrp and why I think we can reach 4 dollar in a not to far future.

First of all let‚Äôs check out data:

From December 2013 till march 2017 we were trending down, that was about 1200 days. After that we saw a 35000 % rise!

After the bullrun we again started the downtrend from January 2018 till December 2021, about 1113 days. We then went up 700%!

From 2021 till now about 1100 days we are moving slowly up but no real bullrun yet. This Is why I don‚Äôt mind holding for the real bull run! I expect XRP to see this run this year. My targets are between 4 and 7 dollar. I just measured the price if we went for a run for only 700%. iF we start a super cycle like in 2017 yeah then this 4 dollar is just the first wave.. But we stay realistic and see what brings us.

What also is interesting is the XRPBTC chart, let‚Äôs check out that data:

In a timeframe of 10 years we only touched the major demand zone (support) 4 times and now for the 5th! We bounced from there;

1700%

The Famous Monkey Story in Every Market!

Once upon a time, a rich man from the city arrived in a village. He announced to the villagers that he would buy monkeys for $100 each.

The villagers were thrilled, as there were hundreds of monkeys in a nearby forest. They caught the monkeys and brought them to the rich man, who paid $100 for every monkey they gave him. The villagers began making a living by capturing monkeys from the forest and selling them to the rich man.

Soon, the forest began to run out of monkeys that were easy to catch. Sensing this, the rich man offered $200 for each monkey. The villagers were ecstatic. They went back to the forest, set up traps, caught more monkeys, and brought them to the rich man.

A few days later, the rich man announced he would pay $300 per monkey. The villagers started climbing trees and risking their lives to catch monkeys and bring them to the rich man, who bought them all. Eventually, there were no monkeys left in the forest.

One day, the rich man announced he would like to buy more monkeys, this time for $800 each. The villagers couldn‚Äôt believe their luck. They desperately tried to catch more monkeys.

Meanwhile, the rich man said he had to return to the city for some business. Until he returned, his manager would handle transactions on his behalf.

Once the rich man left, the villagers were unhappy. They had been making quick and easy money from selling monkeys, but now the forest had no monkeys left.

This is when the manager of the rich man stepped in. He made an offer the villagers could not refuse. Pointing to all the caged monkeys, he told the villagers he would sell them for $400 each. They could sell them back to the rich man for $800 each when he returned.

The villagers were over the moon. Buy for $400 and sell for $800 in a few days‚Äîthey had found the easiest way to double their money. They collected all their savings and even borrowed money. There were long queues, and within a few hours, almost all the monkeys were sold out.

Unfortunately, their happiness did not last long. The manager went missing the next day, and the rich man never returned. Many villagers kept the monkeys, hoping the rich man would come back. But soon, they lost hope and had to release the monkeys back into the forest, as feeding and caring for the noisy monkeys became extremely difficult.

This is exactly what happens when you buy low-quality companies in the stock market. There will be a low-priced stock that no one is interested in buying. A few rich men will suddenly start buying it. The stock price will rise because there are suddenly many buyers and very few sellers‚Äîa classic case of huge demand and no supply, like the monkeys in the forest.

The stock gets plenty of coverage on business channels and newspapers. These rich men will also use tricks like sending out bulk SMS messages, asking people to buy the shares for huge returns, and giving free tips. New and inexperienced investors, hoping to double or triple their investment, get lured in. Finally, the big players who bought the stock early when no one wanted it sell it back to inexperienced investors at high prices.

CRYPTOMOJO_TA,BITCOIN: HISTORICAL AND LOGARITHMIC CHART!,BTC,10,Update post 2,1716538210,67133.41,"This chart is based on historical data and is logarithmic.

I believe that the correct fit is a square root function in the logarithmic chart, meaning that the growth is slowing down on long timescales. BTC cannot continue to grow exponentially; this would lead to insane prices of many millions in 2025. While I am a long-term Bitcoin bull, one has to remain realistic.

The cause of these growth cycles is the halvings, which lead to a supply shock followed by a subsequent rally‚Äîevery time. These are all guesstimates, of course, but I think this chart is realistic.

The long-term goal for BTC in 2025 is around 150K to 180K USD, in my opinion. It won't go much higher afterward and can be seen as the final asymptotic price.

Important Things to Note

- During the 2016 bull run, after breaking its previous ATH, BTC had a 303-day bull run and reached a new ATH of $19,666.
- During the 2020 bull run, after breaking its previous ATH, BTC had a 337-day bull run and reached a new ATH of $69,000.
- In the 2024 bull run, BTC broke its previous ATH in just 500 days, which was not expected. The current situation is that BTC broke out of its previous ATH and is currently retesting it. Based on historical data, we can expect a bull run lasting between 303 and 337 days.

As always, #BTC surprises us. After breaking this descending channel, BTC failed to retest the support and is currently back inside the channel.

Now, 67k to 67.5k are working as support.
After this fakeout, I am expecting a breakout again.

Here we have two scenarios:

In the first scenario, we will bounce from the support level of 67K to 67.5K, break the pattern again, and move forward.

In the second scenario, we might see more downward moves toward the 50MA to retest it and then break the pattern again, and move forward.

During bullish phases, it's common to observe long-term holders (LTHs) offloading portions of their Bitcoin holdings as prices rise.
During bullish phases, it's common to observe long-term holders (LTHs) offloading portions of their Bitcoin holdings as prices rise. This trend was apparent from early 2024 through April, with notable declines in the supply held by the 1-year and 2-year old UTXOs. Despite this selling pressure, the supply of Bitcoin in unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) held for over three years continues to increase, signaling long-term bullish sentiment among these holders.

More than 50% of the total Bitcoin supply has remained inactive on-chain for over a year, reflecting a strong conviction among long-term holders. This inactivity suggests that a significant portion of Bitcoin investors are confident in the asset's long-term value, opting to hold rather than sell despite market fluctuations.

Supply Dynamics and Holder Behavior
As Bitcoin's price recovers from the recent correction to $56,000, we notice a shift in holder behavior. The 1-year+ and 2-year+ cohorts have ceased selling, transitioning from a distribution phase to a holding phase. This change indicates a renewed confidence in Bitcoin's future price potential, as these cohorts choose to retain their holdings rather than liquidate them at current prices.

Bitcoin's technical outlook is currently at a critical juncture, with the price testing significant support levels. The behavior of long-term holders, coupled with key on-chain metrics, suggests a strong underlying bullish sentiment. However, a break below the daily Ichimoku cloud could shift market sentiment, potentially leading to a price retracement towards $64,000. Investors should closely monitor these technical and on-chain indicators to make informed decisions in the coming weeks.

Now, 67k to 67.5k are working as support.
After this fakeout, I am expecting a breakout again.

Here we have two scenarios:

In the first scenario, we will bounce from the support level of 67K to 67.5K, break the pattern again, and move forward.

In the second scenario, we might see more downward moves toward the 50MA to retest it and then break the pattern again, and move forward.

This chart is based on historical data and is logarithmic.

I believe that the correct fit is a square root function in the logarithmic chart, meaning that the growth is slowing down on long timescales. BTC cannot continue to grow exponentially; this would lead to insane prices of many millions in 2025. While I am a long-term Bitcoin bull, one has to remain realistic.

The cause of these growth cycles is the halvings, which lead to a supply shock followed by a subsequent rally‚Äîevery time. These are all guesstimates, of course, but I think this chart is realistic.

The long-term goal for BTC in 2025 is around 150K to 180K USD, in my opinion. It won't go much higher afterward and can be seen as the final asymptotic price.

Important Things to Note

- During the 2016 bull run, after breaking its previous ATH, BTC had a 303-day bull run and reached a new ATH of $19,666.
- During the 2020 bull run, after breaking its previous ATH, BTC had a 337-day bull run and reached a new ATH of $69,000.
- In the 2024 bull run, BTC broke its previous ATH in just 500 days, which was not expected. The current situation is that BTC broke out of its previous ATH and is currently retesting it. Based on historical data, we can expect a bull run lasting between 303 and 337 days.

The #Bitcoin chart indicates that the price is nearing a potential breakout above the resistance line, which is currently around $62.7K. To confirm a breakout from this potentially significant falling wedge pattern on the daily timeframe, we need to see a solid daily candle close above that resistance. Ideally, this close should be above a previous high, such as the candle close around $64.2K. If we manage to break above $62,700 with a candle close above that level, then we can start to feel much more confident that we're actually transitioning towards a more bullish trend in the short term. In case you're wondering, the support line for this wedge is also around $57.5K and 100EMA as support as well.

In my opinion, it's currently best to wait for confirmation and better opportunities.

Over the last day, we've witnessed the breakout to the upside that I talked about in my previous update. Since then, we have confirmed a daily candle close not only above the resistance line but also above the previous high, confirming a new higher high in the price action. Therefore, technically speaking, this is now a bullish reversal on the daily timeframe. We've shifted from lower highs and lower lows to higher highs, which, by definition, indicates a more bullish trend. So once again, when discussing the trend or the broader market movement as of now, we are still looking more bullish than bearish.

The daily #Bitcoin chart shows a continuation of the bullish breakout from the falling wedge pattern. The technical price target for this breakout is the top of the wedge, which sits at around $72,000 to $74,000, roughly aligning with the local highs and the all-time high. Currently, we're approximately halfway between the breakout point and the price target for this falling wedge. So, technically, we still have around a 7% move, give or take, until we hit that technical price target.

The Bitcoin liquidation heat map shows that the price of Bitcoin is currently in the process of liquidating billions of dollars in short positions. As I've been stating here on the channel, this major area of liquidity around 67.5 thousand will act as a magnet, drawing the price towards that area. However, as I have also mentioned recently on the channel, in the short term over the last one or two days, the big players in the market have been defending the price from hitting that level. But once again, this was only a short-term defense; there's only so long you can stop the tide from coming in.
Once we fully start liquidating that major area, which is happening right now, we could potentially see a further short squeeze to the upside. This is another bullish indicator. Overall, as I've been saying repeatedly here on the channel, I'm still very bullish, especially on the larger timeframe. It's just that in the short term, we can see short-term pullbacks and consolidations during the larger bullish moves.

Bitcoin and crypto funding rates across various exchanges are currently highly negative. This negativity in Bitcoin funding rates suggests a bullish sentiment in the market. Essentially, this imbalance between long and short positions means that short positions are paying fees to long positions. As someone in a long position, I'm benefiting from this by receiving passive income from short positions. This situation incentivizes more long positions and encourages existing short positions to close. The resulting buying pressure could potentially trigger a short squeeze if the price rises further in the short term, leading to the liquidation of short positions and driving the price even higher.

The daily Bitcoin RSI is finally attempting a breakout of this massive descending line of resistance, which has been in place since around the beginning of March. For a couple of months now, we've seen this decent amount of resistance in the daily Bitcoin RSI, similar to what we have seen in the past. If we simply look at the last couple of times where we finally saw a breakout in the daily Bitcoin RSI of these major descending lines of resistance, as we can see here in the price action, once the RSI actually broke out above those lines of resistance, we saw a major bullish reversal out of a short-term pullback into a major bullish move over the next couple of months or so. First of all, if we're looking at this first example right here, if we measure out that move from the point of the breakout here in the RSI, that decent amount of resistance from that point, the price of Bitcoin pumped over 80% to the upside over the next four months or so. If we look at the second example from that point of the breakout in the RSI to the next major high in the coin, we pumped for around five weeks, just over one month, and we pumped around 70% to the upside. So once again, we're talking about basically a short-term trend lasting at least 1 to 4 months of a move of around 70 to 80% to the upside. Now, obviously, I'm not saying that we're definitely going to see the exact same thing again. For example, I would not necessarily be expecting precisely a 70 or 80% move from this local low to the next major high, but we can simply look at these previous examples as an idea of what we could potentially expect in the somewhat short term, as in talking about the next one to three months. Also, just for fun, if we measure out a 70 to 80% move in the price of Bitcoin from the local low, right here, a 70% move would take the price of Bitcoin up towards around US$100,000 per Bitcoin and an 80% move would take the price of Bitcoin up around $105,000 per Bitcoin. Now once again, I am not saying that that's definitely going to happen because there's no such thing as a guarantee, but I'm just sharing what has happened previously when we've seen this signal flash, and so that just gives you an idea of potentially what could be coming in the next few months. These signals in the daily Bitcoin RSI are not yet confirmed because the RSI, by default, goes off candle closes, and so we at least need to see if these daily candle closes confirm with the RSI above this line of resistance, even though we have not yet seen the potential confirming breakout in the daily Bitcoin RSI.

In this daily Bitcoin chart we're observing right now, the price is getting extremely close to potentially breaking out of this descent. There's a lot of resistance to this massive falling wedge pattern. First of all, the support line for this fall, which has been supported multiple times for the price, is currently sitting at approximately 58,000. With this descent, there's a lot of resistance sitting at around 63 1/2 to 64,000. Ideally, we need to see at least a solid daily candle close, but ideally a couple of candle closes above 64,000 in order to actually confirm this breakout on the daily timeframe for this massive falling wedge pattern. We can simply look at the top of the wedge, which is sitting at around 72,000, as a major price target to the upside. Once we actually confirm the breakout above this resistance, or if we take a look at the measured move for that breakout to the upside if we see that breakout above that resistance, confirmation also sets up a target at around 74,000, which is very close to the all-time high. So, basically, once we confirm a strong breakout with a candle close on the daily timeframe above 64,000, the next major price targets are simply these local highs at around 72,000 to 74,000.

Stay tuned, I will keep you updated.

The Bitcoin and crypto funding rates are actually surprising me quite a lot right now. Honestly, even while the price of Bitcoin is on the upside in the short term, having a decent bounce back, the funding rate is very, very negative. So, what this tells us is that this is a spot-driven rally.


There is a lot of demand on the spot market buying up Bitcoin, and not many people are trying to lock in the market. There are still a lot of people, in terms of traders, trying to short Bitcoin. So once again, this is making shorting Bitcoin very expensive as the short positions have to pay more and more funding fees to the long positions because the funding rates are negative.


So, once again, as I've already been saying over the last few days, this is yet another ingredient of a potential short squeeze, which could potentially send the price a lot higher to liquidate those short positions.

The Bitcoin liquidation map shows recent activity. The price surged past a significant amount of liquidity, approximately around 62.5 thousand. However, there's still considerable liquidity above the price, ranging from around 64.7 K.

Conversely, there's only a limited amount of liquidity below, approximately at 56.5 thousand. Zooming out to larger time frames on the liquidation chart, we observe even more liquidity above the price compared to below. For instance, major liquidity zones are evident around 67.5 thousand and further liquidity is seen around 71.5 thousand to 72 thousand.

These liquidity zones seem to act as magnets for the price, pulling Bitcoin towards them. Once the price crosses these levels on the chart, billions of dollars of short positions will get liquidated.

This is technically a sign of strength for the price of bitcoin, and as we‚Äôve seen previously, when we see a major breakout in the daily bitcoin RSI above a major descending line of resistance, that usually happens at the very beginning of the next major move to the upside over the next couple of months or so, in the price of bitcoin usually also happens after we have already experienced a decent pullback in the price of bitcoin, which is exactly what we just saw, and this is very no price action to see even during a larger bullish trend, and once again, seeing the signal, confirm here.

Looking at the daily #Bitcoin chart, the price is testing a previous resistance line, which could now act as support if it holds.

If this day candle closes with the price above this line, it might confirm an upward breakout.

But if it closes below, it could signal a reversal. We're waiting for confirmation.

#Bitcoin LiquidationHeatmap is nearing a significant level of liquidity just below its current value, roughly between $62,300 to $62,500.
I've been talking about this lately. Although it might dip in the short run to tap into this lower liquidity, there's even more liquidity waiting higher up, around $67,300 to $67,600. So, while we might see a temporary drop, there's a good chance it'll bounce back up toward the bigger liquidity pool.

FieryTrading,Bitcoin On-Chain: Is The Cycle Over Already?,BTC,1,Initial post,1718108483,67030.0,"In this analysis I want to discuss a (most likely) unpopular view on the market. Namely, that the ""cycle"" is already over and that the peak is in for now.

Preface
This is not my most likely outcome for the markets. You can find my most likely outcome below:

Still, it's always advised to keep an open mind and explore different potential outcomes.

Overview
When we look at the last 7-8 years of Bitcoin's newly created addresses we can see that this value follows a clear boom-and-bust pattern. It peaks (green) during mania when everyone wants to step into the market and it declines after the market has topped (red).

For the people who are wondering about the November 2021 peak: on-chain data peaked in Q1-2021.

What this chart suggests is that the ""mania"" phase of the market cycle is over and that the top is either in or very close. Once the mania phase is over, crazy gains are more rare and trading is more difficult.

I'm interested to hear your thoughts on this idea.

FieryTrading,Learn How To Trade Tradingview's new BBTrend Indicator!,BTC,1,Initial post,1717695575,71147.72,"Introduction
In this analysis I want to take a closer look at Tradingview's newly released BBTrend indicator. It's an indicator on the widely popular Bollinger Bands. You can find more information about the indicator here: www.tradingview.com/...ger-indicator-45015/

Indicators are nice to use, but the most important question remains whether they are useful in trading or not?

I want to present you a very simple, but powerful trading strategy using this new indicator.

Indicators used
- BBTrend: determine the best reversal entries.
- 200-period EMA: assess whether we're trading bullish or bearish.

Strategy
Bullish: price should be above 5% of the 200-period EMA. Light-red BBTrend has to change in trend and become dark red.
Bearish: price should be below 5% of the 200-period EMA. Light-green BBTrend has to change in trend and become dark green.
Investment: risk 5% per stop loss. This means that you lose 5% of your balance if the stop is hit, but gain 15% once the profit target is hit.

Stop and profit targets
Stop-loss: place stop just above the most recent swing-high.
Take profit: 3x the stop-loss distance.

Results
Win-rate: 4/8, 50%
Profit: +42%
(1.15*1.15*0.95*0.95*0.95*1.15*1.15*0.95)
I'm aware of trading within existing trades, but for the sake of simplicity I use this easy profit calculation method.

Final remarks
This strategy works well in strongly trending markets due to the higher probability of the trend continuing the current direction. In periods of prolonged trading around the 200-period EMA it can get tricky to get a good trade in, hence we only trade once we're at least at 5% distance of the EMA.

This trend-following strategy can be used on every asset and on every time frame. Just make sure to be consistent.

The Four Phases of an #Altcoin Bull Market

i) Accumulation : This is where price bottoms out after a long bear market. Prices consolidate and break the downtrend during this period.

ii) First Leg up : Here, prices begin to surge, but many retail investors fail to recognize the trend change, leading them to stay on the sidelines.

iii) Chop : After the first leg up, prices often move sideways, entering a choppy phase, you can also call it a re-accumulation phase after the first leg up, commonly observed after the Bitcoin halving.

iv) Up Only : This is where most of the money is made in a very short period of time, Bitcoin, Altcoins, memecoins everything goes parabolic during this phase.

If you pay attention to the chart, the first three phases typically progress slowly and can be somewhat boring at times, but the real profits are made by positioning oneself in these initial phases.

Impatient individuals who chase after red and green candles are likely to get caught out during the first three phases.

In the final phase, crypto dominates the news, attracting new money, and both Bitcoin and altcoins reach new all time highs.

This is when smart money & early buyers starts unloading their holdings, while retail investors believe the rally will continue indefinitely.

I looked at the timing on the weekly chart to see how long the wave took. It is interesting that it is also surprisingly similar.
The previous BS lasted 19 weeks and today's 20 weeks
The previous BS cooling lasted 6 weeks and today's 6 weeks (strong volume).
(Small volume) The previous BS cooling area lasted 10w and today's is confirmed on June 3rd and then it will be 7 weeks.

With this, we could assume that we have a few weeks until the pump.
Of course, this is only a guess and the actual one may differ, but still, everything is incredibly similar wow",106,44,41.51,looked timing weekly chart see long wave took interesting also surprisingly similar previous b lasted 19 week today's 20 week previous b cooling lasted 6 week today's 6 week strong volume small volume previous b cooling area lasted 10w today's confirmed june 3rd 7 week could assume week pump course guess actual one may differ still everything incredibly similar,9

Going to even smaller charts and comparing the previous BS cooling, there are similarities again.

The Four Phases of an #Altcoin Bull Market

i) Accumulation : This is where price bottoms out after a long bear market. Prices consolidate and break the downtrend during this period.

ii) First Leg up : Here, prices begin to surge, but many retail investors fail to recognize the trend change, leading them to stay on the sidelines.

iii) Chop : After the first leg up, prices often move sideways, entering a choppy phase, you can also call it a re-accumulation phase after the first leg up, commonly observed after the Bitcoin halving.

iv) Up Only : This is where most of the money is made in a very short period of time, Bitcoin, Altcoins, memecoins everything goes parabolic during this phase.

If you pay attention to the chart, the first three phases typically progress slowly and can be somewhat boring at times, but the real profits are made by positioning oneself in these initial phases.

Impatient individuals who chase after red and green candles are likely to get caught out during the first three phases.

In the final phase, crypto dominates the news, attracting new money, and both Bitcoin and altcoins reach new all time highs.

This is when smart money & early buyers starts unloading their holdings, while retail investors believe the rally will continue indefinitely.

i) Accumulation : This is where price bottoms out after a long bear market. Prices consolidate and break the downtrend during this period.

ii) First Leg up : Here, prices begin to surge, but many retail investors fail to recognize the trend change, leading them to stay on the sidelines.

iii) Chop : After the first leg up, prices often move sideways, entering a choppy phase, you can also call it a re-accumulation phase after the first leg up, commonly observed after the Bitcoin halving.

iv) Up Only : This is where most of the money is made in a very short period of time, Bitcoin, Altcoins, memecoins everything goes parabolic during this phase.

If you pay attention to the chart, the first three phases typically progress slowly and can be somewhat boring at times, but the real profits are made by positioning oneself in these initial phases.

Impatient individuals who chase after red and green candles are likely to get caught out during the first three phases.

In the final phase, crypto dominates the news, attracting new money, and both Bitcoin and altcoins reach new all time highs.

This is when smart money & early buyers starts unloading their holdings, while retail investors believe the rally will continue indefinitely.
We are on the third stage and the fourth is coming soon!!!

When I say that today altcoins and bitcoin are not in a logical circle, it is aimed at the analysis that shows a drop of 57k minimum. Altcoins have made their main decline, but btc did not fall to a minimum of 57k (initially I assumed that btc at a minimum of 57k will bring altcoins to the level where they are now). If I stick with my altcoin analysis, btc won't fall 57k. Personally, I would like to believe that btc will not fall to a minimum of 57k, which will keep a logical circle. The logical circle is due to my personal analysis results, and the change of one side must be logical with the other side.

One commenter sees that there is nothing logical about bitcoin and altcoins anymore, I wouldn't be surprised if he only knows how to copy history and has brain cancer.
Altcoins are low it is obvious and still in reaccumulation area. What hint do altcoins give to Bitcoin? Bitcoin is still in reaccumulation area and today's rise to 70k may be deceptive. Next year 250k or even more depending on what level we see at the end of this year.",199,98,49.25,say today altcoins bitcoin logical circle aimed analysis show drop 57k minimum altcoins made main decline btc fall minimum 57k initially assumed btc minimum 57k bring altcoins level stick altcoin analysis btc fall 57k would like believe btc fall minimum 57k keep logical circle logical circle due personal analysis result change one side must logical side one commenter see nothing logical bitcoin altcoins anymore surprised know copy history brain cancer altcoins low obvious still reaccumulation area hint altcoins give bitcoin bitcoin still reaccumulation area today's rise 70k may deceptive next year 250k even depending level see end year,4

The Four Phases of an #Altcoin Bull Market

i) Accumulation : This is where price bottoms out after a long bear market. Prices consolidate and break the downtrend during this period.

ii) First Leg up : Here, prices begin to surge, but many retail investors fail to recognize the trend change, leading them to stay on the sidelines.

iii) Chop : After the first leg up, prices often move sideways, entering a choppy phase, you can also call it a re-accumulation phase after the first leg up, commonly observed after the Bitcoin halving.

iv) Up Only : This is where most of the money is made in a very short period of time, Bitcoin, Altcoins, memecoins everything goes parabolic during this phase.

If you pay attention to the chart, the first three phases typically progress slowly and can be somewhat boring at times, but the real profits are made by positioning oneself in these initial phases.

Impatient individuals who chase after red and green candles are likely to get caught out during the first three phases.

In the final phase, crypto dominates the news, attracting new money, and both Bitcoin and altcoins reach new all time highs.

This is when smart money & early buyers starts unloading their holdings, while retail investors believe the rally will continue indefinitely.",219,85,38.81,four phase altcoin bull market accumulation price bottom long bear market price consolidate break downtrend period first leg price begin surge many retail investor fail recognize trend change leading stay sideline chop first leg price often move sideways entering choppy phase also call re-accumulation phase first leg commonly observed bitcoin halving iv money made short period time bitcoin altcoins memecoins everything go parabolic phase pay attention chart first three phase typically progress slowly somewhat boring time real profit made positioning oneself initial phase impatient individual chase red green candle likely get caught first three phase final phase crypto dominates news attracting new money bitcoin altcoins reach new time high smart money early buyer start unloading holding retail investor believe rally continue indefinitely,20

I have doubts, the candle closes red and a new candle opens on July 1st and closes green on October 1st.

I closed the previous analysis in such a way that I believed that April would be in the red, and maybe even May. So far I haven't been wrong

I like my original May-June time prediction, in other words June 1st. If I see a BS earlier before June 1st, I'll probably assign it to SPD.

If you think this candle closes green, good luck and hope I'm wrong.

Yes, I may be wrong, but I believe my truth.
In the big picture I am extremely bullish, I liken Bitcoin to the new S&P that was built to grow forever, as long as we exist.

The Four Phases of an #Altcoin Bull Market

i) Accumulation : This is where price bottoms out after a long bear market. Prices consolidate and break the downtrend during this period.

ii) First Leg up : Here, prices begin to surge, but many retail investors fail to recognize the trend change, leading them to stay on the sidelines.

iii) Chop : After the first leg up, prices often move sideways, entering a choppy phase, you can also call it a re-accumulation phase after the first leg up, commonly observed after the Bitcoin halving.

iv) Up Only : This is where most of the money is made in a very short period of time, Bitcoin, Altcoins, memecoins everything goes parabolic during this phase.

If you pay attention to the chart, the first three phases typically progress slowly and can be somewhat boring at times, but the real profits are made by positioning oneself in these initial phases.

Impatient individuals who chase after red and green candles are likely to get caught out during the first three phases.

In the final phase, crypto dominates the news, attracting new money, and both Bitcoin and altcoins reach new all time highs.

This is when smart money & early buyers starts unloading their holdings, while retail investors believe the rally will continue indefinitely.

RocketBomb,Is Bitcoin Preparing for a Bull Run?,BTC,2,Initial post,1718130932,67114.05,"Hello, dear friends!üíô Bitcoin has started to show a decline in price, even though other markets are experiencing growth.

Despite the current price decline, Bitcoin's behavior closely mirrors the patterns observed before previous bull runs. Analyzing historical data, we can see that Bitcoin often undergoes a phase of consolidation and accumulation before significant upward movements. This phase is characterized by narrowing price ranges and reduced volatility, often forming technical patterns like triangles or flags on the charts.

One of the key indicators suggesting a potential bull run is the breakout from these consolidation patterns. In the past, when Bitcoin has broken out of a well-defined triangle or flag pattern, it has often led to substantial price increases. Currently, we are observing similar behavior, where Bitcoin appears to be consolidating and forming a base of support. This base-building is crucial as it allows for the accumulation of buying pressure, which can propel prices higher when a breakout occurs.

It's important to acknowledge that Bitcoin's current decline could be part of the larger consolidation phase, potentially shaking out weak hands and setting the stage for a more robust recovery. Such pullbacks are not uncommon and can often precede stronger bullish momentum as the market stabilizes and regains confidence.


Moreover, market sentiment and external factors play a crucial role in the development of a bull run. Positive news, regulatory clarity, or institutional adoption can act as catalysts, driving investor confidence and increasing buying activity. With the macroeconomic environment showing signs of stability and other markets experiencing growth, Bitcoin's current consolidation phase might just be the calm before the storm.

Pay attention to the price formations I've circled in yellow and pink, and notice how the price reacted afterwards.


In conclusion, while Bitcoin is currently seeing a price decline, its behavior still exhibits patterns that have historically preceded bull runs. If this trend continues and we see a confirmed breakout from the current consolidation phase, it could signal the start of another significant upward movement. Investors should keep a close eye on key support and resistance levels, as well as external market factors, to position themselves advantageously for the potential bull run.

Thanks for Your attention and interest in my work.

RocketBomb,BTC $ 255 000 this BULL RUN?,BTC,2,Initial post,1708698888,51123.29,"Hello, everyone!üí•

Today, let's talk about Bitcoin and its prospects for the coming years. What should we expect? Let's compare the two previous bull runs.

To start with, every four years, the reward for Bitcoin miners decreases, a phenomenon known as halving.

Why is everyone so waiting for halving? Well, when the next halving occurs, miners receive half the rewards, reducing the speed of new Bitcoin mining and consequently lowering its inflation rate (devaluation).

No one knows for sure what will happen next time, but it's worth making predictions based on the history of previous years. Especially since it's very transparent and repeats itself time and time again.

Let's take a look at the chart I've prepared for You.üßê


On the chart, I've marked two wedges, which I've colored white. The blue arrows indicate the regularity of three-year cycles. This is the time it takes for these channels to form and the regular way they break out.

After the breakout, the growth percentage is approximately the same ~550%.üöÄ

Assuming that the breakout occurred last year, from the $40,000 mark (the price has already corrected as it has done every time before - orange circles), and the growth will be like previous times, theoretically, the price in this bull run could reach the $255,000 mark.üò±


üßêDo you believe in such growth? Are you concerned about the situation in the world? Share your thoughts in the comments.

üí°I also wanted to share my previous chart with you. Perhaps you'll find it interesting.

RocketBomb,More Than Money üí∏,BTC,3,Initial post,1712067101,65406.55,"Hello, friends! üòä What do you associate trading with? üßê For most of us it's exchanges and investments are primarily associated with big money. However, trading in the financial markets not only provides opportunities for earning but also for significant skill development and personal growth.


Here are the top 4 qualities that trading helps to develop:

1. Strategic thinkingüß†

Systematic approach and having a well-thought-out strategy distinguish a professional trader from a gambler. Seeing that Bitcoin is rising and immediately buying it ‚Äì that's not how it works: You need to follow rules to earn not situatively, but in the long term. First and foremost, adhere to risk management, which determines 90% of success.

The main rules of risk management in trading that are useful in any endeavor:

In trading: Invest no more than 1-2% of your deposit in one trade.
In life: Don't put everything at stake for short-term gain: soberly assess what you can risk so you won't regret it later.

In trading: It's not so important how much you earn. It's more important how much you lose or don't lose.
In life: Weigh the pros and cons of every serious decision.

In trading: Diversify risks, invest in different instruments so that potential losses from one asset are offset by profits from another.
In life: Always have a plan B, and preferably plan C as well, to achieve your goal. Because if something can go wrong, it will.

In trading: Cut losses to a minimum, let profits grow.
In life: Don't waste energy, time, and resources on what doesn't bring benefits or doesn't work out. Strengthen what's strong: focus on what You do best.


2.Stress toleranceü´®

Trading is not the easiest way to earn a living: you need to be mentally prepared for both profits and losses, not succumb to emotional impulses, and maintain self-control. Sometimes you have to ""rise from the ashes"" and start over from scratch. However, just like in life. Only 2-3% of traders have natural resilience: the rest need to develop it.

Here are some tips from me, which I have formulated from my own experience:

""To develop resilience, allow yourself to make mistakes, take on challenges, and solve complex problems. In doing so, you become stronger.""

""Learn to be flexible, not confined to your internal boundaries. ""

""Don't be afraid to be yourself, to develop internal freedom and individuality, so you can accept your mistakes without criticism. A successful trader is confident, free from societal judgment, and doesn't need to be perfect: they pursue their own goals, not dreams imposed by others.""

3. IndependenceüïäÔ∏è

One of the main advantages of trading is freedom: there are no bosses above you, you manage your own time and resources, and you are solely responsible for your actions. You decide how, where, and how much to invest, what risks to take, and so on.

The ability to take responsibility for oneself, not blame others for one's mistakes, and be independent in decision-making is a quality that is valued not only in trading. Independent, self-aware individuals progress faster in their careers, build harmonious relationships, and establish large-scale businesses.

4. Developing üéì

You can't learn trading once and for all: the market is not static, it's constantly changing. Yesterday, for example, only a few knew about cryptocurrencies, and today fortunes are made on them.

So don't miss the opportunity to learn more, interact with like-minded individuals. Thanks to the Trading View platform for providing such an opportunity. Here You can create your own charts, see what others think, and study educational content.

In conclusion, folks, trading is a unique simulator that develops discipline, forecasting skills, responsibility, independence, psychological resilience, and a drive for self-improvement. All You need is diligence, discipline, and a community of like-minded people! Wishing You success!üòò

If Bitcoin manages to break through the crucial 65,650 level, it could serve as a significant signal for the bullish trend, indicating a possible victory over the bearish trend. We can see 70 000 - 71 000 soon!

Don't forget to keep an eye on this fractal for potential insights into market behavior. üëá

For clarity, I divided our chart into two parts - the left side showing the 9-hour timeframe, and the right side showing the hourly timeframe.

üëêOn the longer timeframe - the left side - we see that the price has broken out of the triangle upwards. Many of You, seeing a fake breakout from the same triangle before, might rightfully ask,<< could this be another fakeout?>> In my opinion - no, because the price has already consolidated sufficiently above. So, we have a breakout of the triangle.

üëêNow, let's move to the chart on the left - the hourly one! There we see our breakout with the price formed in more detail! We can observe impulsive movements and the formation of a short-term channel, looking at which we can expect the price to rise to the 67,500 level. Then, we may either continue forming this channel by lowering the price to 66,100 and then rising again to 67+.

I think this will be the accumulation period before the moon flight:))

Sharing with you today is a potential long-term view on Bitcoin which should be of great help in making strong long term investment trading decisions.

Considering November 2013 action where Bitcoin achieved a peak of 1116$, this high followed immediately with about 426days (About 1 Year) of bear market which gave out almost 86% drop from the then ATH this drop ended in the month of January 2015.

Then immediately after the achieved low of January 2015, price begin to rally again which break the previous ATH (1116$) and reached a new peak at exactly 1065days (2yrs, 9months) after with 19817$. This peak was achieved in December 2017.

Exactly after the new peak BTC took a massive dip of about 85% again to reach a new bottom within a duration of about 396days (About 1 Year) of Bear market. The drop ended in the month of January 2019 which make the January to be a special month from my research.

After, the achieved bottom of 3081$ in January 2019, Bitcoin price begins to rally for a new ATH again, which break the previous high. This rally so far had taken about 1035days (2yrs, 8months) with a fresh ATH of 69270$. This ATH was achieved in November 2021.

ASSUMPTIONS FROM THE ABOVE
The correction of price From Nov 2013 (Peak) TO Jan 2015(Bottom) = 426days with 87% drops
The correction of price from Dec 2017 (Peak) TO Jan 2019(Bottom) = 396 days with 84% drops

Therefore, Correction from current ATH of 69k is expected to take at most 396days or less. Considering the rate of adoptions of Bitcoin, then the value of the current correction will be lesser to that of previous dip values. Thereby expecting max of 80% drop with price of 13800$.

Potential End of Correction is JANUARY 2023. This means prepare your long term investment for this period.

Next ATH is expected to happen in the next 3years within November to December 2025.

Note: Bitcoin will likely not give out a dip more than 80% drop due to lot of Institutional adoptions.

Should this rejection materialize, focus should pivot to the immediate BUY BACK ZONE for potential re-accumulation strategies.

Why was price action arrested just shy of sixty thousand dollars?

On the above daily chart two flag patterns are shown. Actually I should say one, because there is some very intriguing facts about those flags, and that is:

1) The angle of each flag is exactly the same, 172 degrees. In other words the candlestick touch points of the previous flag are mirrored by the second without deviation. Coincidence?

2) Lower test points, exactly 42 bars part. From the first to the last exactly 42 days came to pass. And what is the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything is?

First, look at the price action. We have a bullish flag, that's what everyone sees. The market makers count every cent on their accounts, and this is a pretty good opportunity for them to make a lot of money by trapping retail traders. What will a typical retail trader do in this situation? Probably buy/long BTC at around 71k to 75k. That's where the whales step in and start selling, sending BTC back to 63k!

Why 63k? This is a strong support because we have an unfilled FVGAP + Point of control (POC) of the previous market structure. I really don't see any bullish sentiment during the summer season, as statistically, Bitcoin has been going sideways. 

From the Elliott Wave perspective, we are in wave 5 of the first impulse wave, which is of course very bullish for the long-term, but buying at the end of wave 5 is probably not a good idea. What successful traders generally do is wait for an ABC corrective pattern to form before buying.

But what all people want to know is when to sell Bitcoin and prepare for the next bear market. Bitcoin's bear markets are very devastating, and the usual correction is around 80% - 70% from the peak. That's why it's good to time a good exit point if you are a trader. If you are a hodler, then you probably have your bitcoin in a Trezor hardware wallet and you don't care about volatility, even though it's not nice to see that your portfolio is down by 70%.

To determine the exit point, we need to use technical analysis on a weekly/monthly scale. In the chart, you can see price action in recent years and all these swings during previous bear markets. We can draw a massive ascending parallel channel and take a look at the market cycles. Selling at the top of the upward-sloping trendline is definitely a good idea, but will Bitcoin offer this opportunity? Sometimes markets turn bearish just before key levels. 

From a time perspective, October or September 2025 seems like the right time to sell Bitcoin and go into fiat or stable coins. Then buy again, cheaper after the crash. The 2021 peak is a strong level, and Bitcoin should never go below this level. I think Bitcoin volatility should decrease, and we should not see tremendous crashes anymore, but a 50% or 60% crash is something that is definitely very likely. Forget about 80% or 90% of the crashes that happened in 2015 or 2018.

This chart is a representation of the logarithmic scale. If you switch to a classic linear scale, we get a target for the whole bull market of only around 130,000 USD.

Xanrox,"Bitcoin - 10% crash is coming, buy at 62k (here's why)",BTC,8,Initial post,1716967352,68366.26,"Bitcoin is preparing for a pretty significant crash (in June). Why do I think so? We need to look at the previous price action because in May, Bitcoin pumped by 25%. If we take a look at May's price action, we can see that the uptrend created a FVGAP at 62k, and these gaps tend to be filled sooner rather than later. This is, of course, not the only reason why I am bearish. 

From the Elliott Wave perspective, Bitcoin finished the first impulse wave (1) and after such move we can expect a corrective ABC pattern because markets always move in waves. In general, a typical retracement for waves (1) is 0.618 FIB and also 0.382 FIB in strong bull markets. The 0.618 FIB overlays perfectly with the mentioned FVGAP, which gives us a pretty solid buying opportunity if the price reaches this level. The next good opportunity is to short Bitcoin on the futures market. 

The next reason why I am bearish is this small red trendline. As you can see, the trendline is breaking down, which is, of course, a sign of weakness. This trendline is part of the rising wedge pattern, so it adds to the overall bearishness. Currently, I am bearish, so be careful during the summer as the price action is not the most volatile for Bitcoin during this season.

Xanrox,Bitcoin - New all time high soon! (Follow this channel),BTC,18,Initial post,1716107966,67100.67,"Bitcoin is breaking out of the bear market structure and creating a new uptrend that will lead to an all-time high! This thesis is supported by the fact that after the halving event, Bitcoin always goes up (statistically, 100% probability). The halving event took place 1 month ago and cut the reward for mines by half. It's recommended to trade with the trend to increase the probability of success in your trades.

From a technical perspective, Bitcoin has been moving in the ascending parallel channel, so you can definitely take advantage of that and buy/sell Bitcoin at the upward sloping trendlines! With TradingView, you can set an alert, and when it hits, you will get notified. 

What are the resistances on the way up? As I mentioned, the upward-sloping trendline of the parallel ascending channel is the first one. The second one is the FAIR VALUE GAP (FVGAP) which was created in April 2024. Usually, the start of the GAP and the end of the GAP are strong levels by themselves. You can use these levels for your short-term trades with leverage. These resistances Bitcoin needs to break before a continuation to a new all-time high; I don't see any other significant levels worth mentioning. Always choose the strongest levels to increase the probability of success.

I am bullish on Bitcoin, and I believe we will see prices above 100k in Q3/Q4 2024. Let me know in the comment section - are you still waiting for a big crash to buy the dip?

A lot of people are calling for Bitcoin winter, but I don't think so. I see the recent price action as a great buying opportunity on the other side. 

It is always important to do an Elliott Wave technical analysis to see the full picture. From my point of view, Bitcoin has formed and completed the WXYXZ triple-three corrective pattern inside this bullish flag. What you want to do as a trader is trade a breakout above the flag or buy at the bottom of the flag, potentially trading a breakout of the last Z wave.

Xanrox,Bitcoin - new ATH soon. Best time to buy now,BTC,8,Initial post,1715071365,64148.0,"Bitcoin looks very strong at this moment. We can see that the price is breaking out of the descending parallel channel on the daily chart. The price is above the channel and has already retested the downward-sloping trendline. We should see a strong pump from the current price. 

Why is bitcoin pumping? From a technical perspective, it's pretty easy to say. Take a look at the previous price action. We have a false breakout below the key levels; it was a bear trap created by market makers to get as much liquidity as possible for their huge orders, as they cannot simply do so whenever they want. 

From the Elliott Wave perspective, there is nothing bearish at this moment. I see that the corrective pattern WXYXZ has been completed, and we are starting a brand new impulse wave to the upside. The next target is around 71k because we have his important red trendline, so make sure you are aware of it.

Xanrox,"Bitcoin - Ultimate bottom will be here, but now 13% crash!",BTC,2,Initial post,1715676697,61853.19,"The price action of Bitcoin is relatively boring on the higher time frames, why is that? The answer to this question may be that summer is almost here, and statistically, Bitcoin has been going sideways pretty much every summer. Usually, the fun begins in August/September, when the volatility comes into the market. 

What can we expect from Bitcoin in the following weeks? I am expecting a 13% crash because we need to hit the major red trendline on the daily chart. This trendline should hold the price of Bitcoin to the end of the bull market, so you want to buy every touch of it! We also have a 200-daily moving average that is currently pretty much at the same price as the mentioned trendline. The 200-MA is considered a strong dynamic support or resistance from huge institutions and hedge funds, so you definitely want to keep an eye on it. 

The price of Bitcoin is inside the bullish flag pattern, as you can see on the chart. This is a pretty strong confluence with the trendline to buy cheaper Bitcoin. Right now, I am bearish and expecting lower prices in the next few days and weeks. The bulls still need to show more strength before I can turn bullish. The best option seems to be to be patient and buy at the touch of the major red trendline! You can also place a high-leverage trade here if you trade futures.

Xanrox,Bitcoin is ready to reach 70k! Here is why.,BTC,1,Initial post,1715328292,63010.01,"Bitcoin has finished its corrective pattern (ABC ZigZag) and is ready to go higher. My next target is 70k (69577) because we have a 1:1 FIB extension level at this price. Usually this Fibo level is pretty significant; that's why I am expecting a small crash from it, but after that, we should continue much higher, to the 1.618 FIB extension. Of course, we need more information and data to precisely establish long-term targets. 

On the chart, we can see 2 parallel channels, the first is larger than the second. The larger one is still valid as the price is inside it, so we can use this knowledge to our advantage and potentially sell/short Bitcoin at the touch of the upper sloping trendline of the ascending parallel channel. But not now, Bitcoin is bullish, so enjoy the ride! 

From the Elliott Wave perspective, I also have to be bullish because I see the dream setup of every Elliott Wave trader. What you want to do is catch the 3rd impulse wave and ride it until the end before the 4th corrective wave occurs. Basically, you want to trade a breakout of the 2nd wave or catch the bottom of the 2nd wave with the Fibonacci retracement tool.
