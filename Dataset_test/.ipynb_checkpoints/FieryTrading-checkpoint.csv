FieryTrading,Bitcoin On-Chain: Is The Cycle Over Already?,1,Initial post,1718108483.0,"In this analysis I want to discuss a (most likely) unpopular view on the market. Namely, that the ""cycle"" is already over and that the peak is in for now.

Preface
This is not my most likely outcome for the markets. You can find my most likely outcome below:

Still, it's always advised to keep an open mind and explore different potential outcomes.

Overview
When we look at the last 7-8 years of Bitcoin's newly created addresses we can see that this value follows a clear boom-and-bust pattern. It peaks (green) during mania when everyone wants to step into the market and it declines after the market has topped (red).

For the people who are wondering about the November 2021 peak: on-chain data peaked in Q1-2021.

What this chart suggests is that the ""mania"" phase of the market cycle is over and that the top is either in or very close. Once the mania phase is over, crazy gains are more rare and trading is more difficult.

I'm interested to hear your thoughts on this idea. Like I said, it's not my most likely outcome, but it's possible that we've topped after the ETF mania."
FieryTrading,Bitcoin Potentially Forming An Inverse Head & Shoulders: Dump?,1,Initial post,1717834523.0,"After yesterday's sell-off I started to wonder what would happen if BTC would fall again and how the price action would look like.

If BTC were to go down again I'd look for a retest of the 61k-60k area (purple dotted line). This area has proven to offer strong support, and can be a stepping stone for an inverse head & shoulders pattern.

Keep in mind that BTC going down to 60k is (in my eyes) less likely than making a new all-time high soon. The pattern has yet to be confirmed. However, if we go down you are prepared."
FieryTrading,Learn How To Trade Tradingview's new BBTrend Indicator!,1,Initial post,1717695575.0,"Introduction
In this analysis I want to take a closer look at Tradingview's newly released BBTrend indicator. It's an indicator on the widely popular Bollinger Bands. You can find more information about the indicator here: www.tradingview.com/...ger-indicator-45015/

Indicators are nice to use, but the most important question remains whether they are useful in trading or not?

I want to present you a very simple, but powerful trading strategy using this new indicator.

Indicators used
- BBTrend: determine the best reversal entries.
- 200-period EMA: assess whether we're trading bullish or bearish.

Strategy
Bullish: price should be above 5% of the 200-period EMA. Light-red BBTrend has to change in trend and become dark red.
Bearish: price should be below 5% of the 200-period EMA. Light-green BBTrend has to change in trend and become dark green.
Investment: risk 5% per stop loss. This means that you lose 5% of your balance if the stop is hit, but gain 15% once the profit target is hit.

Stop and profit targets
Stop-loss: place stop just above the most recent swing-high.
Take profit: 3x the stop-loss distance.

Results
Win-rate: 4/8, 50%
Profit: +42%
(1.15*1.15*0.95*0.95*0.95*1.15*1.15*0.95)
I'm aware of trading within existing trades, but for the sake of simplicity I use this easy profit calculation method.

Final remarks
This strategy works well in strongly trending markets due to the higher probability of the trend continuing the current direction. In periods of prolonged trading around the 200-period EMA it can get tricky to get a good trade in, hence we only trade once we're at least at 5% distance of the EMA.

This trend-following strategy can be used on every asset and on every time frame. Just make sure to be consistent.

Good luck!"
FieryTrading,Bitcoin Bull-Flag Breaking Out,3,Initial post,1717417486.0,"In my most recent BTC analysis I talked about a pending break out of a bull-flag pattern. My previous design was not the one the market agreed upon, so had to redraw the bottom support.


As expected, the price is breaking out through the top resistance as we speak. Wait for the candle to close for confirmation.

My view is quite bullish, so I'm expecting this break out to lead to a new ATH in the coming weeks."

FieryTrading,Bitcoin's LAST Hurdle: Short-Squeezing To New Highs!,2,Initial post,1717603696.0,"Bitcoin has shown that it's ready for a new all-time high by printing relatively big green candles over the last 3 days. However, the 73k-74k area remains an area of big resistance. Previous buyers are looking for an exit, whilst patient bears wait for the perfect short.

My best guess is that Bitcoin is going to trade around the purple area for a couple of days, flushing out over-leveraged bulls and bears. However, the break out that will follow will likely be violent.

With all the short-stops lying above the current all-time high, it's more than likely that the new all-time high break out will take us multiple percentages above the current ATH. I'm personally aiming at 80k within the first 1-2 days, potentially even 90k in the first week after the break out.

Be patient and dont trade small fake-outs."

FieryTrading,"BNB Massively Undervalued? $10,000 Potential!",1,Initial post,1717231233.0,"BNB has been making some extraordinary moves last cycle, where it bottomed around $4.5 and made it to $700 during the next top.

Looking at the chart, we can clearly see that BNB follows a bullish channel pattern. My assumption is that this channel will hold and that BNB will make a move towards the top of the channel.

$10,000 is possible, it's a ""mere"" +5,000% move from bottom to top, as opposed to last cycle's +16,000%.

Are you bullish on BNB? Share your thoughts."
FieryTrading,ðŸ”¥ Bitcoin In A Bull-Flag: Wait For Break Out!,1,Initial post,1716935805.0,"After successfully completing an inverse head & shoulders pattern, Bitcoin has seemingly found its way up again.


Over the last week, trading has been characterized by many ups and downs, but the trend is still bullish.

Bull-flags are classically bullish continuation patterns, so a bullish break out through the top resistance is to be expected at some point.

Wait for the market to show clarity. Wait for a break of either resistance of support. A new all-time high is around the corner."
FieryTrading,ðŸ”¥ Bitcoin's HUGE Cup & Handle Pattern Breaking Out!,1,Initial post,1716569845.0,"In this analysis I want to take a look at a long-term pattern that BTC has been following over the last few years. In my eyes, BTC's price action closely resembles a cup&handle pattern, which is a bullish break out pattern.

Assuming that the handle's low is in, we can place our stop right below it. Target at 150k. Be aware that the pattern has not yet been completed; wait for a new all-time high before entering a position.

Share your thoughts!"
FieryTrading,"ðŸ”¥ AVAX End Of Accumulation, Bulls Rejoice!",1,Initial post,1716377519.0,"After a month of trading below the diagonal purple resistance line, AVAX has finally broken out. The break out was accompanied with high volume, further reinforcing the bullish narrative.

My expectation is that there's going to be some kind of altseason in the coming weeks, boosted by Ethereum's ETF optimism.

For now, the signal on chart is my bet."
FieryTrading,ðŸ”¥ Ethereum Bull-Flag Break Out!,1,Initial post,1716233904.0,"After months of bearish price action, Ethereum has finally broken out of a bull-flag pattern. The fact that we're up >10% on the break out is extremely bullish.

I think this is the start of a prolonged bullish trend over the summer. First target placed at $5000."
