Once upon a time, a rich man from the city arrived in a village. He announced to the villagers that he would buy monkeys for $100 each.

The villagers were thrilled, as there were hundreds of monkeys in a nearby forest. They caught the monkeys and brought them to the rich man, who paid $100 for every monkey they gave him. The villagers began making a living by capturing monkeys from the forest and selling them to the rich man.

Soon, the forest began to run out of monkeys that were easy to catch. Sensing this, the rich man offered $200 for each monkey. The villagers were ecstatic. They went back to the forest, set up traps, caught more monkeys, and brought them to the rich man.

A few days later, the rich man announced he would pay $300 per monkey. The villagers started climbing trees and risking their lives to catch monkeys and bring them to the rich man, who bought them all. Eventually, there were no monkeys left in the forest.

One day, the rich man announced he would like to buy more monkeys, this time for $800 each. The villagers couldn‚Äôt believe their luck. They desperately tried to catch more monkeys.

Meanwhile, the rich man said he had to return to the city for some business. Until he returned, his manager would handle transactions on his behalf.

Once the rich man left, the villagers were unhappy. They had been making quick and easy money from selling monkeys, but now the forest had no monkeys left.

This is when the manager of the rich man stepped in. He made an offer the villagers could not refuse. Pointing to all the caged monkeys, he told the villagers he would sell them for $400 each. They could sell them back to the rich man for $800 each when he returned.

The villagers were over the moon. Buy for $400 and sell for $800 in a few days‚Äîthey had found the easiest way to double their money. They collected all their savings and even borrowed money. There were long queues, and within a few hours, almost all the monkeys were sold out.

Unfortunately, their happiness did not last long. The manager went missing the next day, and the rich man never returned. Many villagers kept the monkeys, hoping the rich man would come back. But soon, they lost hope and had to release the monkeys back into the forest, as feeding and caring for the noisy monkeys became extremely difficult.

This is exactly what happens when you buy low-quality companies in the stock market. There will be a low-priced stock that no one is interested in buying. A few rich men will suddenly start buying it. The stock price will rise because there are suddenly many buyers and very few sellers‚Äîa classic case of huge demand and no supply, like the monkeys in the forest.

The stock gets plenty of coverage on business channels and newspapers. These rich men will also use tricks like sending out bulk SMS messages, asking people to buy the shares for huge returns, and giving free tips. New and inexperienced investors, hoping to double or triple their investment, get lured in. Finally, the big players who bought the stock early when no one wanted it sell it back to inexperienced investors at high prices.

Candlestick Graphs/Charts

Candlesticks are a visual representation of the size of price fluctuations. Traders use these charts to identify patterns and gauge the near-term direction of prices in the cryptocurrency market.

Composition of a Candlestick Chart

This is what a candlestick chart pattern looks like:

As you can see, there are several horizontal bars or candles that form this chart. Each candle has three parts:
1. The Body
2. Upper Shadow
3. Lower Shadow"

How to Analyze Candlestick Chart for Cryptocurrencies
The body of the candle in a candlestick chart represents the opening and closing price of the trading done during the period for a particular cryptocurrency. Understanding this is crucial for candlestick trading. Traders can quickly see the price range of the cryptocurrency for the said period by looking at the chart. Moreover, the color of the body indicates whether the price is rising or falling. For instance, if a candlestick chart for a month with each candle
representing a day has more consecutive red candles, then traders know that the cryptocurrency's price is falling.

Vertical lines called wicks or shadows above and below the body show the highs and lows of the traded price of the cryptocurrency. Traders can use this information to analyze the sentiment of the market towards the
cryptocurrency.

Candlestick Chart Patterns

Candlestick charts are an excellent way of understanding investor sentiment and the relationship between demand and supply, bears and bulls, greed and fear, etc., in the cryptocurrency market. Traders must remember that while an individual candle
provides sufficient information, patterns can be determined only by comparing one candle with its preceding and next candles. To benefit from them, it is important that traders understand patterns in candlestick charts.
Let's divide the patterns into two sections:
‚Ä¢ Bullish Patterns
‚Ä¢ Bearish Patterns
Analyzing these patterns can help traders make informed decisions about buying or selling cryptocurrencies.
Bullish Patterns
‚Ä¢ Hammer pattern
This is a candle with a short body and a long lower wick. It is usually located at the bottom of a downward trend. It indicates that despite selling pressures, a strong buying surge pushed the prices up. If the body is green, it indicates a stronger bull market than a red body."

CRYPTOMOJO_TA,BITCOIN: HISTORICAL AND LOGARITHMIC CHART!,10,Update post 2,1716538210.0,"This chart is based on historical data and is logarithmic.

I believe that the correct fit is a square root function in the logarithmic chart, meaning that the growth is slowing down on long timescales. BTC cannot continue to grow exponentially; this would lead to insane prices of many millions in 2025. While I am a long-term Bitcoin bull, one has to remain realistic.

The cause of these growth cycles is the halvings, which lead to a supply shock followed by a subsequent rally‚Äîevery time. These are all guesstimates, of course, but I think this chart is realistic.

The long-term goal for BTC in 2025 is around 150K to 180K USD, in my opinion. It won't go much higher afterward and can be seen as the final asymptotic price.

Important Things to Note

- During the 2016 bull run, after breaking its previous ATH, BTC had a 303-day bull run and reached a new ATH of $19,666.
- During the 2020 bull run, after breaking its previous ATH, BTC had a 337-day bull run and reached a new ATH of $69,000.
- In the 2024 bull run, BTC broke its previous ATH in just 500 days, which was not expected. The current situation is that BTC broke out of its previous ATH and is currently retesting it. Based on historical data, we can expect a bull run lasting between 303 and 337 days.

I hope this chart helps people understand the long-term growth dynamics of BTC. This idea is presented in a probabilistic manner."

During bullish phases, it's common to observe long-term holders (LTHs) offloading portions of their Bitcoin holdings as prices rise.
During bullish phases, it's common to observe long-term holders (LTHs) offloading portions of their Bitcoin holdings as prices rise. This trend was apparent from early 2024 through April, with notable declines in the supply held by the 1-year and 2-year old UTXOs. Despite this selling pressure, the supply of Bitcoin in unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) held for over three years continues to increase, signaling long-term bullish sentiment among these holders.

More than 50% of the total Bitcoin supply has remained inactive on-chain for over a year, reflecting a strong conviction among long-term holders. This inactivity suggests that a significant portion of Bitcoin investors are confident in the asset's long-term value, opting to hold rather than sell despite market fluctuations.

Supply Dynamics and Holder Behavior
As Bitcoin's price recovers from the recent correction to $56,000, we notice a shift in holder behavior. The 1-year+ and 2-year+ cohorts have ceased selling, transitioning from a distribution phase to a holding phase. This change indicates a renewed confidence in Bitcoin's future price potential, as these cohorts choose to retain their holdings rather than liquidate them at current prices.

Bitcoin's technical outlook is currently at a critical juncture, with the price testing significant support levels. The behavior of long-term holders, coupled with key on-chain metrics, suggests a strong underlying bullish sentiment. However, a break below the daily Ichimoku cloud could shift market sentiment, potentially leading to a price retracement towards $64,000. Investors should closely monitor these technical and on-chain indicators to make informed decisions in the coming weeks.

The #Bitcoin chart indicates that the price is nearing a potential breakout above the resistance line, which is currently around $62.7K. To confirm a breakout from this potentially significant falling wedge pattern on the daily timeframe, we need to see a solid daily candle close above that resistance. Ideally, this close should be above a previous high, such as the candle close around $64.2K. If we manage to break above $62,700 with a candle close above that level, then we can start to feel much more confident that we're actually transitioning towards a more bullish trend in the short term.

What came next was a major bullish move in the price of Bitcoin. But if you're looking at the last time we actually saw a breakout and then a retest and some sort of consolidation, and then a further move to the upside in the RSI, it's like what we're seeing at the moment. The last time we saw something like that was back around mid-September. And if you're looking at the Bitcoin price during that time period, it looks extremely similar to right now. We just had a pullback in the price of Bitcoin. We kind of consolidated somewhat sideways for a few weeks, and even over a month, and then we eventually reversed back into the bullish direction from a short-term trend into another bull trend that lasted for a few months.""

#Bitcoin Update

Over the last day, we've witnessed the breakout to the upside that I talked about in my previous update. Since then, we have confirmed a daily candle close not only above the resistance line but also above the previous high, confirming a new higher high in the price action. Therefore, technically speaking, this is now a bullish reversal on the daily timeframe. We've shifted from lower highs and lower lows to higher highs, which, by definition, indicates a more bullish trend. So once again, when discussing the trend or the broader market movement as of now, we are still looking more bullish than bearish.

Stay tuned for further updates."

The daily #Bitcoin RSI is continuing its bullish break to the upside. The bullish reversal from a downtrend into an uptrend in the daily Bitcoin RSI is evident. Obviously, if you've been following my updates over the last couple of weeks, you'll know that I've been discussing this almost every single day. I've been informing you about this bullish reversal signal for the price of Bitcoin in terms of the trends in the daily timeframe.

Now, it's going well.

The daily #Bitcoin chart shows a continuation of the bullish breakout from the falling wedge pattern. The technical price target for this breakout is the top of the wedge, which sits at around $72,000 to $74,000, roughly aligning with the local highs and the all-time high. Currently, we're approximately halfway between the breakout point and the price target for this falling wedge. So, technically, we still have around a 7% move, give or take, until we hit that technical price target.

Stay tuned for updates.

The Bitcoin liquidation heat map shows that the price of Bitcoin is currently in the process of liquidating billions of dollars in short positions. As I've been stating here on the channel, this major area of liquidity around 67.5 thousand will act as a magnet, drawing the price towards that area. However, as I have also mentioned recently on the channel, in the short term over the last one or two days, the big players in the market have been defending the price from hitting that level. But once again, this was only a short-term defense; there's only so long you can stop the tide from coming in.
Once we fully start liquidating that major area, which is happening right now, we could potentially see a further short squeeze to the upside. This is another bullish indicator. Overall, as I've been saying repeatedly here on the channel, I'm still very bullish, especially on the larger timeframe. It's just that in the short term, we can see short-term pullbacks and consolidations during the larger bullish moves.

In the weekly time frame, BTC quickly moved up with momentum, forming a bullish engulfing candle and breaking the $65.5k to

Looking at the three-day time frame and as of right now, the price of bitcoin is technically still within a larger bullish trend on the larger time frame, also known as a mark. As in case you need to all of these, even a bullish market can contain short-term pullbacks here and there in fact this very market that we‚Äôve been in since around the beginning of 2023 has had multiple pullbacks of more than 20% along the way, and so it‚Äôs important to understand that nothing moves in a straight line and always going to see some short-term volatility if we‚Äôre looking at smaller time frames.

#BitcoinETF are dumping Bitcoin, which contributes to the ongoing pullback in the market.

Looking at this three-day #Bitcoin chart, we can see that the price of Bitcoin is still currently trading below the 0.236 Fibonacci level, which is sitting right around $60,000. At the next three-day candle close, confirmed in around one day from now, if we see the three-day close is confirmed below $60,000, then obviously, that would not be a good sign on this chart. Basically, if we confirm a break below the $60K level with confirmation as the candle closes below that level on large timeframes, in that case, the next major level of support to the downside would be the 38.2% level, sitting around $51,000 to $52,000. That will be, once again, the major support."

Bitcoin and crypto funding rates across various exchanges are currently highly negative. This negativity in Bitcoin funding rates suggests a bullish sentiment in the market. Essentially, this imbalance between long and short positions means that short positions are paying fees to long positions. As someone in a long position, I'm benefiting from this by receiving passive income from short positions. This situation incentivizes more long positions and encourages existing short positions to close. The resulting buying pressure could potentially trigger a short squeeze if the price rises further in the short term, leading to the liquidation of short positions and driving the price even higher.

Bitcoin ETF's
Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday all saw net outflows, with Wednesday's being the largest ever recorded in a single day in the US. Over $563.7 million left Bitcoin that day, causing significant selling pressure and a bearish price effect. This highlights how ETFs can majorly influence Bitcoin's price, depending on inflows and outflows. For instance, a $500 million outflow like Wednesday's can trigger significant price drops.

The daily Bitcoin RSI is finally attempting a breakout of this massive descending line of resistance, which has been in place since around the beginning of March. For a couple of months now, we've seen this decent amount of resistance in the daily Bitcoin RSI, similar to what we have seen in the past. If we simply look at the last couple of times where we finally saw a breakout in the daily Bitcoin RSI of these major descending lines of resistance, as we can see here in the price action, once the RSI actually broke out above those lines of resistance, we saw a major bullish reversal out of a short-term pullback into a major bullish move over the next couple of months or so. First of all, if we're looking at this first example right here, if we measure out that move from the point of the breakout here in the RSI, that decent amount of resistance from that point, the price of Bitcoin pumped over 80% to the upside over the next four months or so. If we look at the second example from that point of the breakout in the RSI to the next major high in the coin, we pumped for around five weeks, just over one month, and we pumped around 70% to the upside. So once again, we're talking about basically a short-term trend lasting at least 1 to 4 months of a move of around 70 to 80% to the upside. Now, obviously, I'm not saying that we're definitely going to see the exact same thing again. For example, I would not necessarily be expecting precisely a 70 or 80% move from this local low to the next major high, but we can simply look at these previous examples as an idea of what we could potentially expect in the somewhat short term, as in talking about the next one to three months. Also, just for fun, if we measure out a 70 to 80% move in the price of Bitcoin from the local low, right here, a 70% move would take the price of Bitcoin up towards around US$100,000 per Bitcoin and an 80% move would take the price of Bitcoin up around $105,000 per Bitcoin. Now once again, I am not saying that that's definitely going to happen because there's no such thing as a guarantee, but I'm just sharing what has happened previously when we've seen this signal flash, and so that just gives you an idea of potentially what could be coming in the next few months. These signals in the daily Bitcoin RSI are not yet confirmed because the RSI, by default, goes off candle closes, and so we at least need to see if these daily candle closes confirm with the RSI above this line of resistance, even though we have not yet seen the potential confirming breakout in the daily Bitcoin RSI.

In this daily Bitcoin chart we're observing right now, the price is getting extremely close to potentially breaking out of this descent. There's a lot of resistance to this massive falling wedge pattern. First of all, the support line for this fall, which has been supported multiple times for the price, is currently sitting at approximately 58,000. With this descent, there's a lot of resistance sitting at around 63 1/2 to 64,000. Ideally, we need to see at least a solid daily candle close, but ideally a couple of candle closes above 64,000 in order to actually confirm this breakout on the daily timeframe for this massive falling wedge pattern. We can simply look at the top of the wedge, which is sitting at around 72,000, as a major price target to the upside. Once we actually confirm the breakout above this resistance, or if we take a look at the measured move for that breakout to the upside if we see that breakout above that resistance, confirmation also sets up a target at around 74,000, which is very close to the all-time high. So, basically, once we confirm a strong breakout with a candle close on the daily timeframe above 64,000, the next major price targets are simply these local highs at around 72,000 to 74,000.

Stay tuned, I will keep you updated.

The Bitcoin and crypto funding rates are actually surprising me quite a lot right now. Honestly, even while the price of Bitcoin is on the upside in the short term, having a decent bounce back, the funding rate is very, very negative. So, what this tells us is that this is a spot-driven rally.


There is a lot of demand on the spot market buying up Bitcoin, and not many people are trying to lock in the market. There are still a lot of people, in terms of traders, trying to short Bitcoin. So once again, this is making shorting Bitcoin very expensive as the short positions have to pay more and more funding fees to the long positions because the funding rates are negative.


So, once again, as I've already been saying over the last few days, this is yet another ingredient of a potential short squeeze, which could potentially send the price a lot higher to liquidate those short positions.

The Bitcoin liquidation map shows recent activity. The price surged past a significant amount of liquidity, approximately around 62.5 thousand. However, there's still considerable liquidity above the price, ranging from around 64.7 K.

Conversely, there's only a limited amount of liquidity below, approximately at 56.5 thousand. Zooming out to larger time frames on the liquidation chart, we observe even more liquidity above the price compared to below. For instance, major liquidity zones are evident around 67.5 thousand and further liquidity is seen around 71.5 thousand to 72 thousand.

These liquidity zones seem to act as magnets for the price, pulling Bitcoin towards them. Once the price crosses these levels on the chart, billions of dollars of short positions will get liquidated.

The daily Bitcoin chart, taking a look at the daily Bitcoin RSI, and over the last one day, we have now officially confirmed the breakout in the daily Bitcoin RSI of this descending line of resistance and so on the daily timeframe.


This is technically a sign of strength for the price of bitcoin, and as we‚Äôve seen previously, when we see a major breakout in the daily bitcoin RSI above a major descending line of resistance, that usually happens at the very beginning of the next major move to the upside over the next couple of months or so, in the price of bitcoin usually also happens after we have already experienced a decent pullback in the price of bitcoin, which is exactly what we just saw, and this is very no price action to see even during a larger bullish trend, and once again, seeing the signal, confirm here.

I've been talking about this lately. Although it might dip in the short run to tap into this lower liquidity, there's even more liquidity waiting higher up, around $67,300 to $67,600. So, while we might see a temporary drop, there's a good chance it'll bounce back up toward the bigger liquidity pool.
