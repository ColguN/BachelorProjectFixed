weslad,Bitcoin Trading trading cycle,1,Initial post,1668055308.0,This is very long term view and still very much in play. According to the chart we still have 50 more days for the bear to drag price down with potential targets towards 13k and extended zone of 12k.
weslad,POTENTIAL BITCOIN LIFECYCLE,3,Initial post,1653505733.0,"Hello all,

Sharing with you today is a potential long-term view on Bitcoin which should be of great help in making strong long term investment trading decisions.

Considering November 2013 action where Bitcoin achieved a peak of 1116$, this high followed immediately with about 426days (About 1 Year) of bear market which gave out almost 86% drop from the then ATH this drop ended in the month of January 2015.

Then immediately after the achieved low of January 2015, price begin to rally again which break the previous ATH (1116$) and reached a new peak at exactly 1065days (2yrs, 9months) after with 19817$. This peak was achieved in December 2017.

Exactly after the new peak BTC took a massive dip of about 85% again to reach a new bottom within a duration of about 396days (About 1 Year) of Bear market. The drop ended in the month of January 2019 which make the January to be a special month from my research.

After, the achieved bottom of 3081$ in January 2019, Bitcoin price begins to rally for a new ATH again, which break the previous high. This rally so far had taken about 1035days (2yrs, 8months) with a fresh ATH of 69270$. This ATH was achieved in November 2021.

ASSUMPTIONS FROM THE ABOVE
The correction of price From Nov 2013 (Peak) TO Jan 2015(Bottom) = 426days with 87% drops
The correction of price from Dec 2017 (Peak) TO Jan 2019(Bottom) = 396 days with 84% drops

Therefore, Correction from current ATH of 69k is expected to take at most 396days or less. Considering the rate of adoptions of Bitcoin, then the value of the current correction will be lesser to that of previous dip values. Thereby expecting max of 80% drop with price of 13800$.

Potential End of Correction is JANUARY 2023. This means prepare your long term investment for this period.

Next ATH is expected to happen in the next 3years within November to December 2025.

Note: Bitcoin will likely not give out a dip more than 80% drop due to lot of Institutional adoptions.
MORE UPDATES TO FOLLOW SOON!!!

Do you want more of this legendary market approach?"
weslad,Dogeusdt Trading idea,3,Initial post,1690226162.0,"DOGEUSDT is showing signs of forming an Adam and Eve pattern, which could lead to a significant uptrend. Doge accumulation should be consider towards the Buy Back zone as a good area to enter positions.

In case of a breakout above the local resistance area on the chart, buying the pullback to this area might offer an opportunity, as it could turn into a massive strong support zone.

The Pattern Neckline zone will play a crucial role as a resistance area, where profit-taking could be considered.

Keep a close eye on market developments and be ready to adjust your trading strategy accordingly."

Congratulations everyone! Doge has reached its initial milestone with a remarkable 150% increase.

A breakout above the neckline could pave the way for another impressive move of 230% to reach the projected setup target."

Doge just created huge opportunity by breaking and staying above the neckline. It is not over another potential 200% to be made. Enjoy guys."

Pre-halving drop confirmed!!! Now, we're gearing up for a major rally as local support holds strong.

Check out the chart analysis:

weslad,XRPUSDT Buy opportunity,1,Initial post,1701192805.0,"The XRP weekly chart presents a compelling opportunity, displaying a potential ascending setup. Price action has consistently respected the bottom trendline, leading to substantial rallies. The immediate focus lies on the demand area for coin accumulation, while maintaining a stop loss below the trendline.

Presently, attention is directed toward testing the neckline, serving as the mid-term target. Your insights and support in boosting these findings are greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your engagement."
weslad,Icpusdt Trading opportunity,1,Initial post,1704773099.0,"The ICPUSDT pair has shown promising signs of emerging from a possible downward trend, with the price encountering a substantial resistance zone around the $15.40 level.

A modest pullback is anticipated at this point, which is likely to precede a bullish momentum. We have identified the retracement target, which is where we aim to re-enter the market.

Additionally, we have accounted for a key support level near the $4.67 threshold. Our intermediate and ultimate price objectives have been outlined on the provided chart.

It is crucial to monitor the immediate resistance level closely; should it be breached, we recommend entering a position as the asset retraces to this level, which is expected to act as support, with our established targets in mind.

We welcome your thoughts and endorsements on this analysis.

Thank you for your engagement."
weslad,Bchusdt trading opportunity,1,Initial post,1710353687.0,"BCHUSDT is displaying a potential rounding bottom formation, suggesting the formation of a cup and handle pattern upon price testing the neckline area. Our plan involves accumulating the coin towards the immediate buyback zone while focusing on the crucial demand level, currently acting as significant support.

The rounding bottom neckline is identified as a potential sell-off area, marking the beginning of a correction for the handle formation.

Subsequently, breaking above the neckline will confirm the final setup target, as indicated on the chart.

We welcome your feedback on our analysis. Your comments and likes are highly valued and appreciated."

weslad,Ethusdt trading opportunity,1,Initial post,1707230374.0,"Ethereum is presently positioned above a pivotal support line that delineates the current trend. Recently, the coin experienced a rejection from its proximate resistance level.

Anticipation of a subsequent rejection upon a retest of this level is warranted. Should this rejection materialize, focus should pivot to the immediate BUY BACK ZONE for potential re-accumulation strategies. The aforementioned trend-defining support line is recognized as a substantial level of interest; while it is expected to sustain price levels, a breach below this threshold would necessitate reliance on the underlying strong demand zone to uphold the asset's value.

Subsequent to stabilizing within this demand zone, the target shifts towards surpassing the current all-time high (ATH), with the current price action suggesting the formation of a potential 'cup' pattern.

Additionally, analysis of the wave pattern within this context reveals the completion of waves one through four, setting the stage for the initiation of the fifth and final wave. This development is pivotal for the formation of the concluding leg of the wave sequence.

Engagement through likes and comments on this analysis is highly valued and appreciated. Thank you for your attention and contributions."
