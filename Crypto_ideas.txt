Tomorrow, 25-April, is a very important date astrologically speaking. Certain planetary movements are pointing toward the resumption of forward action.

What would this imply for Bitcoin?

‚ûñ Bitcoin peaked 14-March and has been consolidating since.
‚ûñ Bullish momentum has been going down.
‚ûñ The current bias is bearish based on multiple bearish signals such as: high bearish volume, weak RSI and lower highs.

The stars have a powerful influence on human behaviour and this forward action magnetic energy can translate into the resumption or continuation of a bearish move that is already in the making.

This is a just a friendly reminder.

Keep an eye on the market because starting tomorrow (25-April-2024), everything can speed up.

üÖ±Ô∏è Done With The Wait! | Guaranteed Success To Those Who Hold!

The next major support level and the one relevant for us, as we look at the charts on a daily basis, sits around $51,000 and $53,000; a range.

$57,000 can be caressed for a very short while but this isn't a relevant level, it shouldn't shine for too long. Lower is more likely and more possible; once the action starts it will go and it will go fast. It will go fast because Bitcoin has been consolidating this move for an entire month and ten days. That's forty days which in the Cryptocurrency market means an eternity, or a long time, because an eternity lasts forever and in this case we are done with the wait.

There is no longer need to wait we are done with it, the market is ready and the market is fed up. The market is saying, "let's move forward!" Straight forward let's move and it is ok if we go down short-term because long-term we are going up.

So, let it drop just a little bit but fast and strong, 40K consider this number but it can end up much lower once the entire move is over and done.

Imagine, if we are going to hit $250,000 in 2025... Why not give a chance to all those new players waiting for lower prices to join the ride?

Buy low and sell high.
Once you have your tokens, your Altcoins, your coins, your Bitcoins be sure to be patient to wait and hold.

It doesn't matter what happens; charts don't lie; numbers can't lie; Bitcoin has been growing since day one!

The short-term is irrelevant; no matter how far down it goes, we hold, we wait and buy more at support. The rise will be nice and high with life changing profits as the result.

Short-term can be messy; long-term success, winning, profits and wealth are guaranteed to those who hold.

Namaste.

üÖ±Ô∏è Bitcoin Daily ‚Äî Update

Here we have a major conjunction of bearish signals.
This is Bitcoin (BTCUSD) on the daily timeframe:

‚ûñ Notice first the "strong lower high" 22-April, now confirmed based on current price action. We have a lower high 8-Apr vs March and now a very strong one as the decline starts to gain speed.

‚ûñ Notice how there is a small bounce once EMA50 is taken out as support. This bounce is the confirmed 22-April lower high and now Bitcoin is trading back below EMA50 on a daily basis. This break and confirmation of EMA50 as support after a lower high indicates that the next move will be down. This down move is expected to hit lower than the 19-April low ($59,650) based on the fact that a lower high will lead to a lower low. This will send Bitcoin rushing down toward ~50K within hours once the continuation is confirmed.

Namaste.

Comment:
Today, Mercury end its retrograde period and stations direct in Aries.
There is still the post-shadow phase which ends 13th of May (when Mercury will enter Taurus ‚Äîmoney/finance).

Each time Mercury goes retrograde, three times per year ‚Äîfor about three weeks, there is a noticeable effect on Bitcoin's price.

Remember, the stars incline not compel.

Mercury and other planets surely have an effect on our reality, our life system (biology) and behaviors. Mercury is the planet of communication.

What effect exactly this has on the market and how this is interpreted by an analyst can be two strongly different themes. Our interpretations can be wrong but the fact that Bitcoin reacts when Mercury moves is no secret... Moving forward means we are back to where we were at before the retrograde start.

The chart confirms my previous assumption and conclusion about this planetary event.

It is not something that we can use in isolation, but an additional tool/signal that we can use and consider for more options to increase our trading success. Sometimes we just need one small clue to push the scale toward one end. In this case, the end of the retrograde marks the end of the consolidation (distribution) phase ... And Bitcoin decides to move lower...

Namaste.

üÖ±Ô∏è Astrology Can Save Your Trading Day!

Let me tell you a story of how just knowing a little bit of Astrology can save your trading day.

Back in late 2022 the market was really down, it was the bear market bottom.

While I was already aware of a potential reversal coming in on November 2022, the market sentiment was still pretty low and it is hard to come-out and say that things will change based on reversal signals when everything is so doom and gloom, this is the truth; but the charts don't lie.

The reversal signals were there and coming from all around us, but the market was still at its most bearish since 2018; aka., the bottom.

Jupiter is one of the biggest planets in the solar system. In astrology it is known as the greater benefic because it brings growth, profits, expansion and good luck. It brings money (if it is well aspected).

Now, you don't need to know Astrology, only looking up what these and other planets are doing can tip the scale to one side. In this case it was to the bulls favor.

Back then Jupiter was retrograde and it ended its retrograde around 21 November 2022. I am not sure right now as to the exact event, planetary movement or aspect that was going on with Jupiter at the time, but knowing that Jupiter is the giver of gift, profits, wealth and good luck, I added two plus two and concluded that we had all the chart signals in place for a reversal and this astrological event would support what I saw coming from the chart.

Long story short, Bitcoin marked the bottom the same day Jupiter moved and that's how Astrology can help even if just one bit ... It cannot be used in isolation as with any other signal, it needs to be combined with other signals for it to valuable for reading charts.

Then again January 2022, Mars the action planet was retrograde and Bitcoin was consolidating, not going up... On the 12th of March Mars went direct and Bitcoin broke up. Again, at this point we were extremely bullish on the chart, tracking the planets helped me clear any and all doubts that everything was about to go up‚Äî this is early 2023. All planets in the solar systems started to move forward at the same time and look what happened... Everything turned out so great that people belief now that it is impossible for Bitcoin to drop.

It is ok. Bitcoin is here to stay.

Bitcoin is going up and growing up, long-term. But short-term, prepare for the crash ... And remember, knowledge of the planets can save your trading day.

Namaste.

This is a strong scenario right now and something we have all been wondering...

How are you feeling today?

With so many Altcoins now really strong but yet to complete their bullish cycle and Bitcoin ultra-bullish, it calls for additional growth many people say...

I hope you are having a wonderful start to your week!

‚ûñ Bitcoin is trading near resistance, at All-Time Highs but this does not mean that it must drop.

The fact that the market cycles only between up and down makes it pretty easy to predict what type of movement will come next.

Right now we are experiencing a surge, a rise, an up-wave...
This up-wave will inevitably end in a major correction but when?

So, what do you think?

üëâ Will Bitcoin continue rising to $100,000 before the correction or start going down right away?

Leave a comment...

Bulls or bears, which one you pick?
We will count and see who wins.

Thanks a lot for your support.

Namaste.

Comment:
Currently we are witnessing the resumption of the bearish move that started after Bitcoin hit a new All-Time High on the 14th of March this year.

This current move is something that we've been tracking for a while.

‚ûñ When prices are low, we look for entry opportunities to go LONG.
‚ûñ When prices are high, we look for entry opportunities to go SHORT.

The type of action we are witnessing confirms the All-Time High.

With a strong bearish close today, a confirmation of the ATH also means a confirmation of the next major market move, a drop.

After the drop we resume up, we grow up all the way through the Moon, to the Sun and the Stars.

Namaste.

Comment:
The week did not start good but is only half way through and Bitcoin is still high up.

While we have a very, very strong bearish bias, we continue to focus on the chart.

This week is important and decisive based on the phase of the market cycle in which we find ourselves.

The week started green, Boom! and we get a new high but still a daily lower high and immediately it turns red. It is not bad to be Bitcoin right now at $69,000 but that is coming from the ground up.

The fact that it tried to move higher first and quickly turned make this a rejection, a bearish signal.
A bearish signal right now with adds up to the 11-Mar. session as well as to the fact that we have three weeks red in a period of four weeks and Bitcoin struggling to move higher as not seen in a long while. The chart screaming 'caution' all around.
Apr 11
Comment:
Have you seen the situation with Bitcoin Cash?

It just went through its halving event and what followed was a bearish move that is very strong, pointing towards a major correction.

Bitcoin's halving event is getting close.

Litecoin went on to produce a correction after the halving and now Bitcoin Cash has gone big red, like really big just days post-halving.

Now, this can be a positive... Please bear with me for a few minutes.

üÖ±Ô∏è One Last Hurray?

Another one?

This isn't bad, imagine the following scenario: Bitcoin is set to correct based on the halving event. Seeing that the correction did not happen already, "pre-halving," we can expect for it to happen post-halving.

In the past we've seen Bitcoin going through small and big corrections, pre- and post-halving.

While for you and for me it is easy to know that a bullish wave leads to a bearish wave, this is not the case for everybody. Many new market participants are being hyped about the halving because they don't know how it works, etc. The event can be used as speculated the Spot ETF launch would be used.

Notice that while Bitcoin is still strong it stalled and lately we've been seeing some really bad news in the press (God bless journalist, writers and reporters ‚ÄîMay God Bless You!).

Bad news not affecting the market negatively is good news.
But too much bad news will eventually reflect on the market price and that's when the correction will be apparent in its full force.

There we can be one last jump say to 80, 84K, 100K maybe? and then the correction... Or straight down?

The halving is only two weeks away.

Leave a comment with your thoughts... Let's see what you have to say!

The daily session is now closed and we have a neutral candle by all definitions: A Doji, no new highs nor lows, weak volume, etc.

This means that the signal coming off the 9-Apr. session remains in place.

We did experience some volatility but nothing we haven't seen from recent days.

If you have any questions feel free to leave a comment.

Thanks again for reading the trade ideas, charts and updates, and for enjoying these amazing trades.

Namaste.

Comment:
One very strong point in favor of the bulls that needs to be mentioned is the current price. Bitcoin has been ranging and is currently trading at ~$70,000 and fails to move any lower, it has been sideways for a while now.

The interesting and revealing part is that 70K is less than ten percent away from the all-time high. This tells us that Bitcoin is actually challenging resistance at this point. The more resistance level is challenged, the weaker it becomes.

Say prices move below 70K to hit 68K or 65K; strongly bearish but again, as it moves above 70K we need to consider the other scenarios and adapt just as the market does.

Down or up?
A very strong move is about to develop, that's for sure.

Namaste.

Comment:
The hourly action is becoming really compressed, a break is about to happen soon.
This type of action will normally lead to a breakdown based on experience, this is what I am seeing with the increase in volatility at this juncture.

Related markets are bearish while the DXY is bullish. Watch out!

üÖ±Ô∏è BITCOIN'S TECHNICAL ANALYSIS SIMPLIFIED

Let's try and make it super-easy shall we?

I know we can have a difference of opinion but still, try looking at it from my perspective and then you can go back to yours.

It is like opening up, experiencing the other side and then going back.
It is a way to really appreciate what the other has to say.

See, sometimes we can get stuck with one point of view and somehow belief that anything different from what we belief is impossible; that's ok.

We all go through all sorts of emotions and experiences but in the end, the market tends to find a way to teach us a lesson and humbles us down once more, once again. And yet, even to this day we continue to read what the chart has to say.

Let's do this... We will keep it extremely simple and I am sure that you can appreciate the chart signals that I am sharing with you regardless of what Bitcoin does. The market can be unpredictable but technical analysis works.

The market can change in an hour, in a day, in a week, in a year, in a month; it can take as long as it needs, it normally takes as long as it wants. It can change right now, after I publish this, or it can continue in the same trajectory for some time but, regardless of what the current situation shows, change is always sure to come; this is specially true when dealing with a newly created, highly volatile and amazing market. This is absolutely true when dealing with the humans and their lovely reality... You can always expect to be amazed.

Ok... Here is the daily chart:

‚ûñ 5-March shows the highest volume in years and the session ended red. This is not the top but this session produced the highest volume.
‚ûñ 14-March we get a new ATH, a higher high vs 5-March but the volume is lower and the session closed red. Right after this day we have a change of pattern in price action. The pattern has been corrected but the change is still a "signal," that we are now aware off.
‚ûñ Trading volume is dropping daily.

That's it!

What is this telling us?

Bitcoin is going up or down? No!

The bears are in and entered the game with force on the 5th of March.
They are active now and surely getting ready to make their move.

Yes! The bulls did a great job and we love it, we all won but the volume here is revealing that they no longer have much ammunition and thus getting closer to losing price control
Apr 12
Comment:
A breakdown is happening now on the daily timeframe:

Bitcoin is moving below EMA21 and EMA10.

üëâ The lower low should settle below $60,000 as this move develops.

It is early but we have a lower high and the bears are starting to show... Do you agree?
Apr 13
Comment:
Bitcoin is now trading below EMA50 daily... The correction is now in place, already happening.

üëâ The 60K target is an easy one, expect to hit 50K within days and likely lower...

üëâ Based on this simple chart below, minimum target would be 44,000-46,000!

Namaste.

Comment:
The daily session is now closed and so it is confirmed that Bitcoin is trading daily below EMA50; medium-term bearish potential is now active.

The trading volume is not that high but still above the daily average. More volume likely to come at the next support level.

The weekly timeframe looks good and it is the first time that EMA10 has been tested as support since January 2024. Moving below this level activates the bearish potential on this long-term timeframe.

See the chart:

‚ûñ Notice how EMA50 weekly sits at ~$43,000.
‚ûñ MA200 weekly sits at ~$33,333.

I would say the minimum support challenge would be MA200 but it can go lower.

Namaste.
Apr 14
Comment:
My dear friends, consider this: Bitcoin has been closing green since August 2023, seven months straight. April '24 is the first time Bitcoin turns red since August '23. Current price action points to the first month red in eight months. This means that there is room for additional low because April is only halfway through.

It is the first time ever that Bitcoin closes seven months green consecutively before the halving, so this is a major development and breaks all patterns. Without failing, every time there is a very strong bullish wave, a very strong correction follows. This is normal and expected.

‚ûñ The peak was hit 14-March.
‚ûñ Bitcoin peaked an entire month ago already (30 days).
‚ûñ Bitcoin already produced a lower high and the current move is the bearish confirmation and continuation.

üëâ It will move lower based on this and other signals.

I just published the monthly Bitcoin chart with the full analysis for this timeframe, you can find it below:

üÖ±Ô∏è Why Bitcoin Will Continue Lower (Bitcoin Monthly) Explained!

Thanks a lot for your continued support.

Comment:
üÖ±Ô∏è What Needs To Happen For Bitcoin To Drop Below $30,000?

I remember we mentioned that Bitcoin was set to correct all the way down to the $26,500 - $38,000 price range, which is the same as the 0.786 - 0.618 Fib. retracement levels for the entire bullish wave that started after the November 2022 market bottom low.

Seeing, feeling and living through the strongest bullish wave since 2021 put a dent on our perspective, it seems that 30K is too low; at least that's what people are saying.

People would ask me:

What needs to happen for Bitcoin to drop that low?
What is going to happen?

I don't know.

People would say:

"It is impossible, BlackRock is going to buy everything!"
"Nobody is going to sell!"
"We are going straight up to 100K!"

The chart does not tells us the event, the catalyst, it only shows what happened in the past and what is happening in the present. With this information we can predict what is going to happen in the future.

Why would Bitcoin drop below 30K?

‚ûñ Maybe a problem with the authorities spills over, like a lawsuit for a big project or something.
‚ûñ Maybe another big exchange goes down.
‚ûñ Maybe a terrorist attack shows up, Covid 3.0, computer viruses or World War...

Now I can see it!

Bitcoin is going down because of the war!

It will recover though.

üëâ It will produce a strong support and then a massive bullish wave ending in a massive bull-run; regardless of what the world does.

News and events will continue to happen;
Everything will continue to happen;
Everything has been happening always...

Life goes on!

Prepare and do what you can to protect yourself and stay safe.

I am wishing you the best.

Namaste.

‚ûñ Bitcoin is now on its third negative week on the weekly timeframe, it is aiming straight down right now digging for a new low:

‚ûñ Let's have a look at the weekly RSI:
The current pattern is calling for a drop to the 40-50 range to start.

‚ûñ Here is the weekly MACD:

Look at the current peak. A curve is starting to form.
This is the highest peak since November 2021.
Each time such a peak shows up a major correction follows.

These major corrections tend to last for at least a few months.

üÖ±Ô∏è Bitcoin | Warning

It seems Bitcoin's next major move is now very close, imminent, something that can start within hours or at the maximum a few days.

This is a continuation of something that started more than a month ago. 50K is not likely to hold...

While Bitcoin can produce a bounce around the 50,000 price level, a bit higher than that, this bounce will definitely lead to lower prices and fast and this to the mid to low 40Ks. So prepare for a very hard, fast and strong drop; once it takes place!

Namaste.

This is only one signal, just one and this is one of the most simple and effective at the same time ‚Äîhow are you feeling today?

The mother of all crashes, truly?

There are always some mixed signals or mixed feelings when reading the Bitcoin chart:
‚ûñ When the chart is clear, it goes the other way.
‚ûñ When the chart is mixed, we don't know what to say.

Either way it becomes hard to predict what comes next but, when we look around, the picture clears itself up.

When we look around, we know exactly what is going to show up.

üëâ As soon as Bitcoin moves and closes weekly below EMA10, the bearish potential is fully confirmed. Right now the bearish bias is just a potential technically speaking, but confirmation is only a few dollars away. Here is the thing, the confirmation is already in but we have to look at other pairs.

Here is Ethereum (ETHUSDT) on the weekly timeframe:

Can you see what I see?

It is already bearish confirmed, already below EMA10.
üëâ This is what is coming to Bitcoin really soon... There will be a major crash within days!

Namaste.

Comment:
After the break of EMA50 as support on the 13th of April, Bitcoin produced a bounce a challenged EMA10 as resistance.

The challenge of EMA10 as resistance failed and Bitcoin ended the bounce; resumed to move lower. This happened on the 15th of April.

EMA50 is the most important indicator on the daily timeframe to gauge the mid-term potential of a Cryptocurrency trading pair. When the action moves below this level, the bearish potential for months is fully confirmed.

‚ûñ Today, 17th of April, it is the first time Bitcoin starts moving below EMA50.
‚ûñ A continuation below EMA50 implies a lower high.
‚ûñ A lower high below thee 5th of March wick low would lead to at least $58,000.
‚ûñ ~$58,500 matches EMA100 (the next level after EMA50) and also our next target based on our long-term lev. short.


üëâ This chart also shows how easy Bitcoin can move toward $44,444 based on MA200 as support.

Comment:
üÖ±Ô∏è Bitcoin Support | Visiting $55,555, $48,000, $44,444, $37,000 and $33,333

Bitcoin is now officially trading below EMA10 on the weekly timeframe, this with the biggest bearish candle since August 2023. This is the only session that is bigger/stronger than the current one since November 2022.


So we have the most bearish session in 245 days and the week is only half way through.

When looking at this chart we can immediately appreciate two levels that will work as support on this current drop this very same week. EMA21 at 54,650 and the first price action based support around the 44,444 - 48,888 price range.

These are strong support and yes, they will hit way below $50,000; fast and easy.
It will go much lower.

Notice the magenta line on the chart sits at $43,800, this is EMA50.
This is a must for the market.
After such strong growth (2023 early 2024), it is really high probability that the market will go and test this level, it always does.

Now, I'll give you this one beginners, rookies and eternal bulls; I say this to you because I know that experienced traders and analysts are quite aware of what is going on and what is coming to us regardless of the ETF hype. Yes, the ETFs turned to be strongly bullish short- to mid-term and this is great, enjoy the profits. But now comes what follows.

‚ûñ We go down after going up.
‚ûñ We go up after being down; that's just how the market works.

A bounce can happen at EMA50 and how Bitcoin behaves afterward we will have to wait and see because the following two levels are very attractive.

üëâ We focus first on the 44.4K but keep in mind that 37,000 - 33,333 is also part of the bearish play.

Namaste.

üÖ±Ô∏è Bitcoin's Support Under Attack!

The more often a support level is challenged, the weaker it becomes.

‚ûñ The black line on the chart represents the main support level right now for Bitcoin on the short-term. This support level range is activate between $59,000 and $63,000. It has been challenged more than five times.


‚ûñ The fact that this level continues to be challenged tells us that the bears have the upper-hand. If the bulls were winning, we would be seeing resistance being challenged rather than support.

Today we have a new low and things are likely to get worse.

Prepare for the crash.
Is better to be prepared than to be sorry later on.

This is a friendly reminder.

‚ûñ Toncoin (TONUSDT) is now entering what is likely to be a very strong correction/bearish wave.

This is clear based on a descending triangle as a top pattern, as well as the highest bearish volume ever on the 19-April 2024 session. These two signals are more than enough but we also have a weak RSI.

‚ûñ Toncoin hit bottom June 2023 and grew all the way through 11-April 2024; 306 days.
üëâ Total growth amounts to 699%.

This is really good and normally a correction follows such strong bullish action.

A correction should lead to a long-term higher low which in turn will lead to a new bullish wave/cycle, and this cycle will end in 2025 with a massive bull-run and new All-Time High.

Namaste.

The Bitcoin 2024 Halving is only 5 days away ‚Äîaccording to CoinMarketCap‚Äî and this is truly a major event in this market. Bitcoin's halving has a huge effect on the entire Cryptocurrency market in a positive way.

The halving is something good and was implemented as a strategy/feature/solution/technique to fight the highly feared and polarizing monetary inflation that we see all across the world with conventional fiat currencies and CBDCs. Bitcoin is rock solid and has been growing since day one.

The Bitcoin halving has no real immediate effect.

The only change that is implemented within the system is a reduction of the total number of Bitcoins minted each time a new block is mined. The minted Bitcoins and transaction fees are distributed to the winner of the block reward; the miner that solved the highly complicated and convoluted cryptographic hash-puzzle. They have literally millions of computers working as calculators to solve computer riddles, to organize codes. Welcome to the future!

Money is now digital and as with everything, digital money comes and go!

How are you protecting your money?
Are you aware that Bitcoin is going down rather than up?

üëâ Bitcoin is growing and has been growing forever. Bitcoin is growing and has been on a growth trajectory for as long as we can remember. Bitcoin is going up.
Bitcoin is growing, it will keep on growing for sure but it doesn't move straight up. The signals are in; three weeks red, break below EMA10. The 2024 Bitcoin halving will lead to a major correction but this correction ends in a higher low and we continue growing in 2024, 2025 and beyond.

Patience is key.

Take profits or not?

You do whatever is best for you.
You do what works for you...

Experience, wisdom, knowledge and charting can help you choose what is best and what works.

Namaste.

Incoming sell-off?

A very large amount of Bitcoins have been transferred to Binance...

"üö® üö® üö® üö® üö® üö® üö® üö® üö® üö® 16,276 #BTC (1,006,601,602 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to #Binance"

We wait in suspense for the halving event.

Comment:
It seems all the sell orders will come in together at once.
It is as if the whales are loading up all of their accounts, in preparation, in concert and when people least suspect the event will start. Not the halving but the sell-off.

The chart remains bearish.
The daily candle closed with no change; the bias remains 100% bearish for the short- to mid-term.

The weekly session stays the same and remember the monthly analysis; the month is already red and set to close red but for the closure we still have 12 days left. What will happen in those 12 days?

Here is another bearish signal: There are no bullish signals short-term.
Look at any timeframe, no reversal signals, no high volume buys, no huge upwards volatility, nothing.

Overall, the BTCUSD continues aiming lower.

Namaste.
Apr 19
Comment:
Huge bullish candle on the daily timeframe...
The problem? The day is not yet over.

Watch how this whole move turns into a liquidation move and the market resumes in the same direction it was headed yesterday.

These market moves happen because many people went 20-30X SHORT at around 60-62,000 (wrong move).

A move to $66,666 would liquidate all over-leveraged rookie traders, all those selling SHORT at support rather than resistance and with 20/30X Lev. rather 3X as the risk entails.

When these people are liquidated, down we go!

Note: If Bitcoin closes the day above $66,600 (12 hours from now) this would definitely become a very strong bullish signal. Closing below = bearish.

Comment:
"The last Bitcoin halving happened on Apr 19 2024, 20:09:27"

Comment:
üÖ±Ô∏è WHY MINING? Just Print More Bitcoins...

When I first learned about Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies, one of the main concerns was centered around mining.

People were really afraid because of the energy consumption. Some people were worried that mining would be the end of the world because of global warning and all those things. Real worries I should say.

Some years later a volcano blew up sending trillions of tons of CO2 into the atmosphere. The thing went on for months, the sky turned black and many people went through a really hard time... Nobody cared about global warning at this point.

The good news is that the volcano gave us a lesson: Bitcoin mining doesn't matter because, if we can survive the trillions of tons of CO2 emitted by volcanos every single day, then we can survive the negligent amount of energy consumed to produce Bitcoin... But why is this a problem in the first place?

I shall explain.

Bitcoin is a solution.
Bitcoin is the solution to a problem.

The intention in the creation of Bitcoin was to create a type of money that is deflationary.

Without going too deep into economics, let's just say that a large portion of the global population is no longer happy with fiat currencies and CBDCs because they are inflationary currencies. Meaning that their supply can always be inflated and thus the value of the currency tends to decrease over time. This decrease in the value of the currency as its supply increases results in an increase in the price of the things we buy on a daily basis, which we call inflation; we all hate it.

The solution is Bitcoin.

Now, FIAT money is inflationary because it requires no energy to produce, no effort, it can be created out of thin air so in a way, it has no real value. It only has the value we give it and give it value and that's great. This value comes by decree.

Bitcoin requires energy to produce on purpose.
Bitcoin requires capital to be minted on purpose.

In this way, any and every single Bitcoin that is created has real value; and this value is the energy, money, effort ‚Äîmining‚Äî that was put into producing this good.

Since it takes time, money and energy to produce this good, it cannot lose value easily. It cannot be easily inflated.

At the same time, we have this feature on the system called the halving, which reduces the amount of Bitcoins that are created every 10 minutes. So each time you have less Bitcoins being produced but it still requires energy to be produced and thus its price tends to increase rather than drop.

Since we have less Bitcoins...
Since it has a fixed supply...
The currency is programmed to maintain its value overtime or even rise.

The highly energy consumption process needed to create Bitcoin is not a problem but rather a feature in order to protect Bitcoin's value. It is a fail safe mechanism so that no individual player or participant can increase the currency supply, and thus decrease its price, when they have bills to pay.

Make it worth something, in this case energy/electricity and thus money, and since it has real value, it can never be created out of thin air.

In order to create Bitcoin you need energy.
Bitcoin is virtual energy.

Bitcoin is physical and spiritual (electricity) energy that is now available for us to transfer instantly through the Internet.

Bitcoin is the present of money.
Bitcoin is here to stay.

I will do a better job at trying to explain myself next time but I hope you understand.

Do you agree?
Are you holding Bitcoin now?

Thank you for reading.

Namaste.

Market conditions are always changing, so we need to be flexible in order to be able to adapt to change.

XRP has been shaking... We had a bearish idea and yielded to commentators pressure (one great reason not to read comments) and went ahead to published a bullish idea; the chart was bullish at the time though. The bears came back and we published a new bearish trade idea... XRPUSD remains bearish.

The initial trade idea that was bearish still stands.
There is a very, very strong bearish potential on this chart. You don't know XRP.
The people behind it will fool you deeply if you start to "hope" and "believe."

I am speaking for traders at this point.
You can buy hold for profits on a rise, you can sell before the drop.

This thing is going down... It is better to get out and buy back lower and let the dream be a dream while we focus on our own personal success and growth.

Last week closed as a long-term lower high with a very long upper wick/shadow... This can lead to maybe 20, 25 or even 30 to 40% red.

It is better to be prepared.
I hope you find this information useful.

üëâ This trade idea can be considered good timing if you decide to SHORT NOW!

Namaste.

Comment:
Update:

‚ûñ Weekly timeframe: Technically within bullish territory. Bearish potential developing. Lower highs still in place.

‚ûñ Daily timeframe: We have a top pattern and today the action is moving below EMA10 and EMA21. As the daily session closes below these levels (0.6262-0.6233) the short-term bearish potential is confirmed.

We are active with a SHORT on this pair.
Apr 2
Comment:
It seems the drop is about to speed up, I've confirmed through many charts and timeframes. Prepare for the flush. I am thinking that it will last a while, a long one.

We will see though.
Apr 3
Comment:
We have some bearish action but nothing major, still, this is a worrisome chart setup for bulls as a breakdown of the current structure is already taking place.

This is XRPUSD on the weekly timeframe.

The current chart setup shows a rising trend, higher highs and higher lows; this trend is supported by a rising trendline and this trendline is now at risk. Moving below can activate a strong drop and this is already happening.

I used an internal trendline matching three strong reactions based on candle closure, as well as the wick trendline matching more than ten reactions, so these are solid trendlines.

The break below EMA10 and EMA21 weekly is also of relevance.
(Green and slate blue lines on the chart.)

The bearish bias is only becoming stronger; I'll keep you updated.

Namaste.
Apr 5
Comment:
XRP is now trading below MA200 weekly, a major bearish development:

Closing below this level, with the weekly session closing in two days, would open the doors for a strong and fast drop. Relevant support levels can be seen on the chart.
Apr 8
Comment:
‚ûñ Last week XRPUSD closed red, activating some bearish signals.
‚ûñ This week XRPUSD starts green, invalidating those signals.

It needs time to develop.
Apr 12
Comment:
Now! The lower highs on a long-term basis have been happening for exactly three years now, since 12-April 2021, see the chart:

All the signals mentioned previously continue to be valid, intact and now gain strength as they've been confirmed. XRPUSD continues bearish.

‚ûñ We can see a Doji 11-Mar (#1 on the chart).
‚ûñ After this Doji we have a green session that closed higher than the previous one but ended lower based on the candles wick. The last three weeks are red.
‚ûñ This week XRPUSD started green and we now have a full rejection with prices moving below EMA10 and EMA21.

üëâ While this is all negative/bearish, XRPUSD is still trading weekly above EMA50 at 0.5613, which is a major, major support level. As long as this level holds XRPUSD weekly is safe.

üëâ If XRPUSD moves below EMA50 weekly, expect the biggest drop since July 2023 to take place.

Thank you for reading.

Namaste.
Apr 13
Comment:
Our first target hit which is around 0.4200.

This breakdown is a continuation and break of support, which means that this isn't the end.

There is another support target to be hit (~0.3000).

I hope you make good profits during this bearish wave.
Apr 17
Comment:
I will share a new trade idea with the "long-term buy zone" soon as soon as XRPUSD reaches its support range.

I think this pair goes through one last major flush and we are done with the correction for XRP. After this, long-up.

There can be an accumulation phase after the drop but we will see.
We will ride the full wave to new All-Time Highs with lev. and spot.

Namaste.

Comment:
Look at this, the long-term support trendline we've been discussing remains intact when we use the linear chart:

Here is the log chart for comparison, the trendline remains valid in many ways:

Hello my fellow Cryptocurrency lover, I am looking at the Bitcoin Dominance chart today at your request; let's see what the chart has to say!

First, an introduction!

The Bitcoin Dominance chart is an index, it shows Bitcoin's dominance within the Cryptocurrency market.

This chart will not tell you if Bitcoin or the Altcoins are going down or up but this is something we can extrapolate from the data.

‚ûñ We can read the chart and/or make a prediction.
‚ûñ Reading the chart is super easy.
‚ûñ Making a prediction is also easy.
‚ûñ What can be hard is to be accurate.

I can read this chart and succeed with my prediction but this doesn't necessarily mean that Bitcoin or the Altcoins will move in certain ways. The way the market behaves will vary depending on the market phase and cycle.

For example:

‚ûñ Bitcoin dominance going up can be translated into Bitcoin growing faster than the rest of the market.

‚ûñ Bitcoin dominance going up can also mean that the major Altcoins are dropping more and faster than Bitcoin. So Bitcoin can drop together with the Altcoins and yet the dominance goes up.

‚ûñ Bitcoin dominance can go up if Bitcoin rises while the rest of the market drops.

‚ûñ Another interpretation is the Altcoins market growing when Bitcoin dominance goes down (for obvious reasons), etc.

You decide how to interpret the information, we will focus on the chart.


Bitcoin Dominance Weekly Timeframe @AlanSantana

We have a bullish chart. The black line on the chart stands for MA200 and BTC.D is trading safely above this level which is strongly bullish.

We have an ascending triangle that already broke bullish as well. The action currently stands above Fib. resistance (now support).

We have a very clear increase in trading volume as Bitcoin's dominance rises.

While bear volume was strong in early March, last week close fully nullify these bearish sessions and the technicals are now full green.

The RSI is really strong at 65 but showing a weak bearish divergence since October 2023.


Prediction

Let's see what we can do.

Last week wicked at resistance but closed below.

‚ûñ We have many bullish signals with a bullish chart but a tricky market situation, Bitcoin is set for a major correction.

Here is my prediction:

üëâ The Altcoins have gone down much more than Bitcoin, the big market cap. ones.
üëâ The Altcoins being more advanced in their correction, will bottom before Bitcoin.
üëâ The Altcoins will start to recover before Bitcoin based on these assumptions.

üëâ As Bitcoin continues with its corrections while the Altcoins recover, BTC.D moves down.

The chart is bullish and pointing up, but my prediction says: Down we go!

Namaste.
Apr 18
Comment:
Let's have a closer look at the ascending triangle; daily TF:

This is a hard one because we have to reach a bearish conclusion on bullish signal, so you can imagine.

‚ûñ We can see the peak 13-Apr. closing the next day below resistance.
‚ûñ Today's session already wicked higher and is aiming lower.

So far the lower timeframe confirms the conclusion we reached on the higher timeframe but things can change.

Make sure to plan for all scenarios and stay safe.
Always secure profits on the way up (or on the way down if you are selling short).

Thanks a lot for your continued support.

Namaste.

The three black crows is the inverse of the very famous "three white soldiers" candlestick pattern.

The three black crows is a pattern that may predict a change of trend, in this case, the end or reversal of the current uptrend.

‚ûñ The week is not over so this pattern is still in the making; not complete, needs confirmation.

Once the week closes, if it does so below 63/62,000, the pattern is complete.
üëâ Bitcoin is headed lower.

In this weekly chart we can see the highest bearish volume since November 2022.
üëâ The signals are in.

There are so many bearish signals that it is actually annoying.

‚ûñ See the Doji early March which produced the All-Time High, another reversal signal.
‚ûñ See the low volume on this exchange; another bearish signal.
‚ûñ See the Coinbase stock, look at Cardano, Solana, Ethereum and the rest.

Everything is bearish but the climax is not in yet.

Yes, Bitcoin corrects ~30% pre/post-halving but this is the past, not today.
In the past, Bitcoin never went for a new ATH before the halving, so everything changed.
Present halving is different and so the correction can also be different.

üëâ One final flush, really strong... And then, months of boring sideways and recovery before the major 2025 Cryptocurrency market bull-run.

Namaste.

Have you ever seen a $50,000 Bitcoin?
There has never been a Bitcoin at $50,000!

I mean, there is no accumulation, consolidation or distribution phase around this level.

Bitcoin has only dealt briefly with $50,000; this cannot be our main support. It can be our first stop but not the main one.

Looking at this structure, the chart; it points toward a strong drop.

We can see the two shoulders of a head and shoulders pattern around 50,000 in late 2021.
This level was dealt with on the way up in February 2024 and a fib. retracement support level matches it on the way down; the 0.382 fib. which is definitely a strong one.

Now, if we look just a bit lower, we have the low 40Ks where Bitcoin produced a consolidation phase in late December 2023 and January 2024; this is a more relevant level.

üëâ This range between 40,000 and 44,444 also holds EMA50, EMA100, 0.5 & 0.618 Fib. retracement levels; this is the main target.

What about lower?

Lower cannot be for whatever reason, but just imagine when the news breakout that some major city has been blown up, or the exchanges, the SEC, the banks and so on.

Bitcoin is the future of money but it still has to grow and evolve.

Growing pains? No!
A normal correction.

Thanks a lot for your continued support.

While Polygon is sure to take part in the first 2024 Cryptocurrency marketwide correction, this is only a short-term move.

Short to mid-term to be more specific as this correction can extend and about this we will know more pretty soon.

Polygon has been growing long-term, it is surely an amazing project.

Cryptocurrency as a whole is something unique; a perfect technology for us now, for the information age (Aquarius).

The bear-market bottom low for MATICUSDT happened June 2022, which matches the orthodox end of the bear market for Bitcoin and most of the major Altcoins.

Drawing a trendline from this major market low and passing through Sept. & Oct. 2023 we can get a trendline support. This can be the correction low, potentially a long-term higher low.

You know in this channel we look at the charts not only as trading opportunities but also for learning. I try my best to explain the signals and market conditions together with the overall market picture.

Being aware of the long-term possibilities of a trading pair is a great way to avoid panic when prices are going down; it is an amazing way to be prepared.

Knowing that Polygon going down is only temporary can help you to stay strong, hold strong or it can help you sell to buy back lower; whatever you do is your choice.

There is a trick with selling and buying back lower.
‚ûñ We can't predict with exactitude the next bottom/low/support.
‚ûñ Market psychology can lead to selling the bottom rather than buying, so a plan is needed to make the most of information like this one.

Regardless of what happens in the short to mid-term, MATICUSDT is set to grow long-term.

‚ûñ 2024 will be an amazing year for Cryptocurrency.
‚ûñ 2025 will be more than great.

üëâ We are looking at $7.65 as a new All-Time High ‚Äîin the vicinity of this price, it can vary wildly.

I see a stop around $2.2222 on the way up with other important points that we will visit and study once the next bullish move shows up.

I appreciate your time.
I appreciate your consideration.
I appreciate you always reading.

Thanks a lot for your continued support.

Namaste.

Comment:
Trendline support has been activated.

We wait a little longer, wait for confirmation and then we start looking for entries in order to enjoy a very strong bullish phase ending in a bull-run in mid- to late 2025.
